  prcs.1.t: "Warriors on the Plateau"
  prcs.1.d: "Standing in front of the outpost at an altitude of more than 5,000 meters, I tightened my military coat. The cold wind carried snow particles and hit my face like countless tiny blades. In the distance, the outline of the Himalayas loomed in the twilight, like a silent barrier.\nThis is my second year at the border outpost. Whenever night falls, looking at the bright moon in the sky, I always think of my hometown thousands of miles away. The braised pork made by my mother, the jasmine tea brewed by my father, and the old locust tree in the yard are all becoming clearer in my memory.\n\"Do you miss home? It's cold, come and have some tea.\" the instructor's voice came from behind. I hurriedly wiped my face, turned around and saluted. The instructor waved his hand, motioning me to relax, took the gun from my hand, and asked me to leave the post and stand on it. Then he handed out a thermos cup from the insulation bag on his waist, which contained hot ginger tea.\n\"When I first came, I often stared at the moon in a daze. \"The instructor looked into the distance, \"Later I figured it out, we are here to allow thousands of families to reunite in peace.\" He pointed to the border in the distance, \"Look, that's our position. The more we stand guard, the more peace our motherland will have.\" \n Under the moonlight, the instructor's face looked particularly resolute. I suddenly remembered the oath I made when I joined the army: to defend the motherland to the death. A warm current surged in my chest, dispelling the chill. \n \"Come, let me show you something.\" The instructor took out his mobile phone and clicked on a video. \"Dad, you didn't come back again this year, Yuanyuan was very unhappy, but Dad is a great hero, so Yuanyuan forgave Dad, but Dad, when can you come back to accompany me, you haven't been back for three years.\" In the video, a little girl sat in her mother's arms, looking only six or seven years old, \"This is my daughter, I haven't been home for three years, I can understand your thoughts, next year I will fight for a place for you to go home to visit relatives\" \n My eyes were wet. The instructor patted my shoulder: \"Remember, we are not fighting alone. There are millions of people behind us supporting us. \"\nIt was late at night, I stood on the sentry post, looking at the bright moon. This time, I no longer felt lonely. Because I knew that on this snowy plateau, there were countless comrades like me, guarding the peace of the motherland with their youth. The moonlight sprinkled on the epaulettes, shining with warm light."

In these years full of vitality and change, we hold infinite visions for the future and move hand in hand towards a more glorious tomorrow! \nSnakes, agile and firm, symbolize wisdom, rebirth and unyielding will.

  prcs.3.d: "After several years in office, Hu Chunhua formally submitted his request to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to resign from the presidency. Subsequently, at the first meeting of the Standing Committee of the 15th National People's Congress, based on the proposal of the Premier of the State Council, the meeting discussed and decided to accept Hu Chunhua's request to resign from the presidency.\n\nAt the subsequent plenary session, Hu Chunhua delivered an important speech entitled "Returning Power to the People". He said: "We have completed the staged reform tasks. Now it is time for power to truly return to the people and for the National People's Congress, the highest organ of power, to fully play its role. "\n\nFinally, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress began to perform the powers of the President. This marks an important step for China to move towards greater democratization."

  prcs.4.t: "China invades North Korea"
  prcs.4.d: "Shocking news came from Beijing: The People's Republic of China declared war on the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today. A large number of troops are gathering at the Yalu River border, and the vanguard has entered the North Korean mainland.\nWhen asked about the reason for the declaration of war at today's diplomatic press conference, the spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied: "The North Korean people have been living a hungry life under the rule of the Kim family revisionism since 1948, while the North Korean rulers have been eating greasy food and having big bellies. This crime has been ignored for too long. Today, China will complete the unfinished business of the past: completely liberate North Korea and let the real revolution come to the Korean Peninsula."\n\nThe North Korean side strongly condemned China's undeclared war. The North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs said: "The invasion of northern imperialism will not make the North Korean people surrender. The Workers' Party of Korea will fight the CCP revisionists to the end. Comrade Kim Jong-un will lead the North Korean army and people to drive the CCP invaders out of North Korea."\nCurrently, videos of the battle between the Chinese and North Korean troops have been leaked on the Internet. We will continue to report on the follow-up of the Sino-North Korean war."

  prcs.5.t: "China invades Vietnam"
  prcs.5.d: "In the early hours of this morning, troops mainly composed of the Chinese People's Liberation Army crossed the Sino-Vietnamese border and officially launched a military operation against Vietnam called armed anti-revisionism. The spokesperson of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced at an emergency press conference that the action aims to "correct the serious deviation of Vietnam's revisionist path" and help the Vietnamese people return to the true socialist track.\n\nThe World Liberation International Headquarters issued a statement saying that the top leaders of the Vietnamese Communist Party have been controlled by "capitalist restoration forces and revisionists", betrayed the revolutionary legacy of President Ho Chi Minh, and became "agents of imperialism in Southeast Asia." The statement emphasized that this action is an "internationalist obligation" and its purpose is to "save the Vietnamese revolution that has fallen into the quagmire of revisionism."\n\nInternational leftists have issued statements in support of China's actions. Some scholars even said: "Vietnam has long deviated from the socialist path, and today's action is a historical necessity."\n\nThe Pacific Treaty member states expressed strong protests. The Japanese Foreign Minister called the move a "serious threat to the stability of the Southeast Asian region" and claimed to provide military assistance to Vietnam at all costs"

  prcs.6.t: "China establishes the World Liberation International!"
  prcs.6.d: "Today, the People's Republic of China held an international conference of unprecedented scale in the Great Hall of the People, officially announcing the establishment of the "World Liberation International". This move was seen by many international observers as another major turning point in the global political landscape after the American Civil War.\n\nChinese President Hu Chunhua delivered a two-hour speech at the conference, emphasizing that "the order of the old world is rapidly collapsing, the dawn of a new world has appeared, and since the real "restoration of order", the power of the proletariat has been unprecedentedly strong", and declared that "now, it is time to let the flames of revolution burn again around the world". The President said that the World Liberation International will unite the oppressed people around the world to build a "world without exploitation". "We will fight to the end for a new world without oppression and oppression, and carry out the unfinished work of all protesters dating back 8,000 years." This move has caused a thousand waves in the international community. Suspicion, panic and ecstasy have converged into a frenzied symphony, shattering the remaining old order. Finally, let us quote a comment. When the world is at the crossroads of multiple crises, Beijing has chosen to pick up the banner of revolution. Is this a historical regression or a kind of progress that we have not yet understood? Perhaps only time can give the answer. In this complex global public opinion field, Beijing seems to have made its own choice, and the world, whether ready or not, will have to face this new reality."

  prcs.8.t: "China invades Burma"
  prcs.8.d: "After Myanmar's People's Defense Army won the civil war, the situation took a surprising turn: China immediately launched a military invasion of the Southeast Asian country. Beijing announced that the invasion was the result of Myanmar's continuous attacks and incursions into Chinese territory before and after the civil war. However, many geopolitical experts agree that the real purpose of the invasion was to safeguard China's strategic interests in the region.\n\nAfter launching the invasion under the pretext of protecting the border and maintaining regional stability, Chinese troops crossed the border into Myanmar and advanced towards key strategic locations. The sudden invasion shocked the international community and raised concerns about a wider regional conflict and humanitarian crisis."

  prcs.9.t: "A ray of hope (Part 2)"
  prcs.9.d: "Minister Liu nodded thoughtfully: "Go on." \n"For example, Caojing Industrial Park, which was originally mainly engaged in the export of electronic products, can now guide some enterprises to switch to the production of medical equipment and household appliance parts that are urgently needed in China. At the same time, a distribution network directly connected to the community is established to reduce the intermediate links." Chen Mingyuan walked to the whiteboard and quickly drew a network diagram, "This not only guarantees employment, but also stabilizes prices and reduces logistics pressure." \n"The key is to cooperate with grassroots organizations." Minister Liu pointed out. \n"Yes, this requires us to reactivate the initiative of grassroots organizations." Chen Mingyuan's eyes lit up, "I have communicated with several street offices, and we can establish a 'resident demand coordination group' at the community level to collect residents' needs, organize centralized procurement, and even consider restoring some cooperative forms." \n"Your idea is very bold, a bit like returning to the collective economy?" Minister Liu showed an interested expression. \n"It's not a simple return to the past, but innovation under new conditions. "Chen Mingyuan explained, "Although our generation has not experienced the planned economy era, we understand what the core of socialism is. In the face of crisis, it is important to ensure that people's basic lives are not affected and to maintain social stability. This is the purpose of our party." Minister Liu stared at Chen Mingyuan for a long time, and suddenly asked, "When did you join the party?" "Sophomore year of university." Chen Mingyuan replied. "You young cadres do have different ideas from us." Minister Liu stood up and patted Chen Mingyuan on the shoulder, "Write a detailed plan, and you will report to the Standing Committee of the Municipal Party Committee tomorrow." Chen Mingyuan was stunned for a moment: "I report directly?" "Young people must dare to take responsibility." Minister Liu smiled and said, "This crisis is different from the past, and new ideas and new methods are needed. You young cadres can show their talents. "\nIn the next two weeks, Chen Mingyuan's "Industrial Mutual Aid Consortium" plan was approved by the Municipal Party Committee. He led a working group and ran around between various enterprises and communities day and night to organize and coordinate the production conversion. The initial resistance was not small. Some enterprises took a wait-and-see attitude towards this semi-planned adjustment, and some grassroots cadres were not used to this way of working.\nBut as the impact of the American Civil War deepened and the chaos in the global market continued to spread, more and more companies realized that participating in the "mutual aid consortium" might be the only way to survive. And when the first batch of companies that switched production showed benefits, more companies began to actively apply to join.\nA few months later, Jiaxing City showed amazing resilience in the crisis. While other regions were still struggling in the quagmire of the crisis, this small city in the south of the Yangtze River was like a small boat sailing steadily through the stormy waves-the supply of basic living materials was sufficient and the prices were stable, the unemployment rate was far below the national average, and the community security was in order. Although the rhythm of life of the citizens has been adjusted, it has not been disrupted. \nThis series of results soon attracted the attention of the provincial party committee. The research team visited the streets and alleys of Jiaxing, went deep into the workshops of enterprises, and shuttled through various communities to comprehensively investigate this phenomenon. After a detailed investigation report and several special meetings, the provincial party committee decided to promote the "Jiaxing Model" led by Chen Mingyuan as a benchmark for the province's response to crises. Chen Mingyuan himself was also promoted to the Provincial Development and Reform Commission to shoulder a more important mission. \nIn the vast land of the motherland, countless passionate cadres like Chen Mingyuan are stepping forward and opening up new paths with amazing courage and creativity. They broke through the shackles of thought, boldly innovated, and lit up a beacon of hope for the motherland in the darkest moment of the global financial crisis. However, they have not yet realized that these radical governance measures taken in times of emergency, like stones thrown into deep water, will arouse what kind of magnificent historical waves in the near future.

  prcs.10.t: "Golden Horse Awards"
  prcs.10.d: "On the playground of the recruit training center in Chenggongling, Taichung, a team of newly recruited conscripts of the Republic of China's National Army is undergoing a four-month standing military service training. Today's training subject is the 3,000-meter weighted long-distance run that scares every "strawberry soldier" in the mouth of the Communist Army. Although the superiors constantly emphasize some nonsense such as "Whampoa Spirit" and "sincere unity", it is obvious that the power of these spiritual atomic bombs is not enough to make these spoiled fledglings learn the principle of the early bird flying first - let alone to help them overcome extreme physical fatigue. The sparse formation on the playground is the biggest ironclad evidence.\n\n"Hey!" The company commander, holding a watch in one hand and a blue record sheet in the other, kicked Lin Chuxing angrily. "Faster! At your speed, the Communists will be the first to capture you as a prisoner in the future!"\n\n"Report, report to the superior..." Lin Chuxing reported breathlessly. "Please, request a rest..."\n\n"Rest? Please, we only require 14 minutes and 45 seconds to pass the 3km race! Can't you hold on to this?" The company commander put a hand under Lin Chuxing's shoulder to stop him from falling forward. "The Afghan Communist Army requires 13 minutes and 40 seconds to pass!"\n\nThe company commander shook Lin Chuxing's shoulders anxiously. "Can you still hold on? If you really can't hold on, go down and rest."\n\nLin Chuxing clearly heard the sneers of several soldiers in the same team, but the darkness in front of him did not allow him to force himself to be a hero. He pulled his legs that were as heavy as lead, untied the helmet strap, held the helmet upside down in his hand like the inner pot of an electric rice cooker, and walked step by step to the shade of the trees beside the playground."

  prcs.11.t: "Grievances Conference"
  prcs.11.d: "Rahul sat in the last row of the conference room with his arms folded, watching Instructor Zhao walk up to the podium. As an ordinary soldier in the Indian Army Infantry Division, he has spent two months in a prisoner-of-war camp. Today, the Chinese organized an event they called a "grievance meeting."\n\n"Welcome everyone to today's exchange meeting." Instructor Zhao said with a smile, translating the language into fluent Hindi, "Here, everyone has a say, regardless of rank. Today we are going to discuss: what kind of comradeship should exist in the army."\n\nThe meeting room was silent. The Indian soldiers looked at each other, and it seemed that no one dared to speak first. Their eyes unconsciously drifted to the backs of the officers sitting in the front row.\n\nAfter a long time, the silence was broken. "I... I want to say a few words. "A timid voice sounded from the corner. Everyone turned to look and saw a thin soldier named Pritt. His hands were shaking, but he still stood up.\n\n"Lieutenant Roy... He often asked us to wash his clothes, fetch water for him, and even asked us to give him massages. Once he said that I didn't wash the clothes clean enough, so he punished me to do fifty push-ups and then beat me with a belt." Pritt said with tears in his eyes.\n\nThe meeting hall was in an uproar. Lieutenant Roy in the front row blushed and turned to glare at Pritt, but under the gaze of the Chinese counselor, he could only grit his teeth and sit back.\n\n"Does anyone else want to share? "Instructor Zhao asked calmly.\n\nThis time, the silence did not last long. One after another, the soldiers stood up and told about the unfair treatment they suffered in the Indian army: their salaries were withheld by officers, they were forced to do free labor for their superiors' families, they were discriminated against because of their low caste, and they were beaten and insulted at will...\n\nRahul was surprised to find that these sufferings that had been suppressed in his heart, once opened, poured out like a flood. What shocked him even more was that there was no soldier present who had not experienced similar treatment.\n\n"Is this normal military discipline?" Instructor Zhao asked, "In the People's Liberation Army, officers cannot beat or scold soldiers, cannot insult soldiers, and cannot ask soldiers to provide private services. The only right of officers is command, and this power comes from responsibility, not blood or caste. "\n\nThree months later, the prisoner-of-war camp held a special event: Indian prisoners of war watched a documentary about the plight of the lower classes in India, followed by a discussion on India's social problems.\n\n"Are your parents, brothers and sisters, relatives and friends also experiencing similar injustices? :" The Chinese counselor asked gently, "When you were oppressed by officers as soldiers, did you ever think that your compatriots were oppressed by the same system?"\n\nThis question hit the hearts of many soldiers. Rahul thought of the poor countryside in his hometown, his father's bent back and his mother's rough hands. Didn't he join the army to escape that kind of life?\n\n"We India claims to be the world's largest democracy, but why are our people still so poor?" An older soldier suddenly asked, "I have been in the army for fifteen years and fought three wars, but my village still has no decent schools and hospitals. ”\n\nFrom that day on, the discussion began to shift from injustice within the army to broader social issues. The Chinese counselors cleverly guided them to think: What caused the gap between the rich and the poor in India? Why is the caste system still so deep-rooted? Why are politicians keen to incite foreign hostility instead of solving domestic problems?\n\nSix months later, when the prisoner repatriation plan was discussed, an unexpected situation occurred. Rahul and more than 30 other soldiers jointly submitted a request to the Chinese side - asking to stay in China.\n\n"We don't want to go back." Rahul said bluntly in a private conversation with Instructor Zhao, "If we go back, persecution may be waiting for us, or even worse. They will treat us as 'brainwashed' traitors. And even if we are not regarded as traitors, we are unwilling to work hard for those blood-sucking officers. "\n\nInstructor Zhao thought for a moment and nodded: "I will ask my superiors for instructions, and I believe your wishes will be taken seriously. \n\nA month later, Rahul and his comrades who chose to stay were transferred to a new base. They began to receive more systematic political and military training, learning organizational work, propaganda skills and guerrilla tactics. \n\n"You will become the spark of the Indian people's liberation cause." Chinese military adviser Li said at the opening ceremony, "When the time is right, you will return to your country, not as prisoners of war, but as liberators." \n\nRahul stood under the flagpole of the new training camp, looking at the red flag fluttering in the wind. He thought of his hometown and his compatriots who were still living under oppression. He knew that choosing to stay meant a road of no return, but also a new beginning. "

Not far away, there were also Soviet Red Army officers who were invited to observe the exercise. They held binoculars and were curiously watching the movements of the various troops. This was the first joint military exercise conducted by the World Liberation Front coalition, and the purpose was to run in the armed forces of the three countries. And the Soviet Union The Russian Red Army showed great interest in this joint military exercise of the East Asian revolutionary forces, hoping to learn something from it to deal with the dense war clouds over Europe. \n\nFor Zhang Youmin, this was his first time to set foot on foreign soil, but for his family, this was not the first visit.

He was using the thermal imaging pod of the Wing Loong 2 to direct an AKD10 towards a square-headed tank.\n\nBut he didn't notice the white smoke rising from the enemy's spawn point. "Damn it's the Hornet again!" He looked at the kill report on the screen and couldn't help regretting why he was in a hurry to find the Japanese Type 90 that had just destroyed him when he was in the sky. His roommate Zhang Wei leaned over with curiosity: "What Hornet? I also have the Skyrim... I'm so surprised, why are you also playing War Thunder?"\n\n"Just started, Chinese system, now there is only a Khalid and a 80UD. The Japanese 90 is too beastly. It can fire two rounds in the time it takes my Khalid to fire one shot. The 80UD is even more blank with only armor-piercing shells. How can it beat it head-on?" Zhou Hang shrugged helplessly, "When I have the Type 99 and the J-11, I will kill all these Japanese. "\n\n"Although the Soviets put some pressure on gaijin in order to promote their own equipment, it is said that the People's Liberation Army also participated in it, strengthening the entire red camp country together with China, but the Khalid you can play is not a hard car itself, you should play to your strengths and avoid weaknesses and make use of the traditional interspersed people's army to attack the opponent from the side.

Although the 620 steel needle at hand could penetrate the enemy, the enemy's four-second one-shot was not a pushover. Lin Min now only had two air-to-air missiles left, and the only one who could help was Zhou Hang's Wing Dragon 2 and the two AKD10s at hand.\n\n"I'll clear the air defense of the opposite house, you can shoot with confidence... Damn, my RWR is ringing!" The alarm from Lin Min's side could be heard even by Zhou Hang with some faint and rapid beeps. "AKD10 is off the shelf, seven kilometers and twenty seconds. "The green box on Zhou Hang's computer has tightly wrapped around the enemy's tanks. When he followed Zhang Wei just now, there were indeed three stupid Abrams tanks with a tile-throwing chair on their heads, exposing their sides. Before Lin Min had time to mark the small map, Zhou Hang got two kills in just seven seconds. The last one just turned around and was hit by Zhang Wei's high-explosive shell and carried away by the overpressure of the machine gun on the roof.\n\n"Countdown ten seconds, nine seconds, fuck Zhang Wei, look to your left, there is a wheeled vehicle!" Zhou Hang looked at the high-speed mobile wheeled vehicle next to the screen and gave the team a yellow mark. Zhang Wei twisted the vehicle body as soon as he heard it. The Italian Centaur was shot through by Zhang Wei as soon as it appeared, and the Type 90 was pulled out directly when it saw Zhang Wei firing. Just as it was about to fire, it was hit by the AKD10 and turned into a burning wreckage.\n\n"Well done." Zhang Wei straightened the vehicle body and said as he drove forward, "Lin Hang, how are you doing? ”\n\n“F14., I twisted off his two Phoenixes, and before the keycaps could react, I sent him away with one shot with my Viper...Fuck Hang, the guy on the opposite spawn point came to fuck me with Adats!”\n\n“Lin Min, why are you in so much danger? The second AKD10 is off the rack.” Zhou Hang locked onto the aluminum box at the enemy’s spawn point, “Zhang Wei, keep pressing forward, and turn right after you reach the slope I marked. Three more tanks are facing you.”\n\n“Received, thank you, comrade drone.” Zhang Wei pressed the W key, “When you graduate, do you want to consider joining the Air Force and flying drones? Our drones are better than Wing Loong 2 now. It just so happens that the Air Force has released a drone simulation software, do you want to try it?”"
  prcs.16.a: "Yeah, that looks good."

  prcs.17.t: "Be the best warrior (Part 2)"
  prcs.17.d: ""Brother Hang, look at the yellow label. The Japanese Type 90 and the fucking Type 577 were eaten up by the Japanese fuel tanks again." Zhang Wei hurriedly reversed, but the Japanese JM33 still got into his crotch of the third-stage Type 99. "It's the fucking fuel tank that exploded again. Why the hell is China a nitroglycerin fuel tank?"\n\n"There's really no way. I've already fired my AKD10, but guess what, hitting the Japanese scalp is a hit." Zhou Hang said angrily, "During the Taiwan Strait, I didn't see the Japanese tanks so hard, but they were still trampled to death together with Abrams."\n\n"Isn't that the stupid Russians? Just now there was an F14, and the two Vipers of the J-8B flew away. It was hard to bite him at six o'clock, but the one-kilometer PILI 5B was able to chase vertically and burn the butt instead of hitting the keycap, and the machine gun was full of sparks. "Lin Min said as he locked onto the F14 with Doyle's radar, "Fuck Doyle, please don't chase the Phoenix, okay?" \n\n"War Thunder is like this, our sunk costs are too high and it's too late. You've only been playing for less than a month and you still have time to quit." Zhang Wei stood up from his seat and walked to Zhou Hang, looking at Zhou Hang's unhappy expression after his drone was destroyed by the Phoenix, "Recently, the Air Force has released a drone simulation software. If you like drones, go play that. Although it's more difficult, at least it won't be targeted by foreign companies. ""
  prcs.17.a: "He sighed and pointed to the mold."

  prcs.18.t: "Be the best warrior (Part 3)"
  prcs.18.d: "It was late at night, but Zhou Hang's dormitory was still lit. His fingertips moved quickly on the keyboard, his eyes fixed on the Wing Loong-2 on the screen.\n\n"Why is it spinning again? This game is so difficult to control the stick."\n\nThe system popped up a task evaluation interface, and several operation clips were automatically cropped out: the angle of attack was too large, the control stick was unstable, and the details were listed by the AI ​​referee. But this was Zhou Hang's seventh failure tonight, and it was almost this problem every time.\n\n"The new plane is finally out, I'm going to sleep." Roommate Zhang Wei closed the computer, climbed up the ladder and turned over to the bed, "Still serving the People's Air Force here."\n\n"One more game, I can do it this time! "Zhou Hang muttered and clicked the retry button with his mouse.\n\nThe drone simulation game that Zhou Hang was playing, sponsored by the People's Liberation Army Air Force and produced by Shenzhen People's Internet Co., Ltd. (formerly Tencent Group), has become popular among military game enthusiasts at home and abroad. The game simulates the full spectrum of operating experiences, from the handheld "Hummingbird" reconnaissance aircraft to the medium and large "Rainbow" series, and then to the heavy "Wing Loong" strike drone. The slogan is "Experience future air combat and add color to the blue sky of the motherland", but players prefer to call it "cyber service" - because it is so realistic that many players who have only used keyboards and mice find it difficult to get started.\n\nZhou Hang switched to the smaller "Flying Eagle-1" single-soldier reconnaissance drone, trying to complete the secret surveillance mission on the edge of the forest. This small drone is theoretically easier to control, but the real airflow simulation added to the game makes it likely to be blown away by a gust of air at any time.\n\n"Why is the wind so strong? "Zhou Hang pounded the table. When the drone he carefully controlled was overturned by a sudden breeze again and swayed and hit the big tree beside him, Zhou Hang couldn't help but feel irritated.\n\n"It's really that big." Zhang Wei's voice came from the upper bunk, "My cousin is a soldier in the border defense. He said that the control difficulty of the small drones in this game is a little lower than in reality."\n\n"Then how do they fly?"\n\n"Why do you think it's called 'cyber service'?" Zhang Wei lifted the pillow and said jokingly, "Do you think it's so easy to win? The drone pilots of the People's Air Force practice this every day, and you are just getting started."\n\nThe phone vibrated, and a message from Lin Min in the next dormitory popped up: "Brother Hang, try 'Rainbow-7', which has better stability in complex terrain and has automatic terrain following function."\n\nZhou Hang replied curiously: "How do you know I'm playing?"\n\n"Nonsense, your game status has always been online. It's three o'clock and you're still not asleep. Will you be able to concentrate in class tomorrow?"\n\n"Are you playing too?" Zhou Hang smiled and switched to "Rainbow-7" as Lin Min suggested. Sure enough, the control feeling was immediately much more comfortable. He carefully adjusted the altitude and speed, letting the drone fly along the ridge and avoid the simulated radar detection area.\n\n"It should work this time..."\n\nAs the mission objectives were completed one by one, Zhou Hang's control became more and more proficient. In this almost demanding simulation game, every successful flight is like a real victory. The mountain scenery on the screen is picturesque, and he can even feel the airflow from Rainbow 7 blowing on his cheeks. When the mission victory prompt finally popped up, Zhou Hang couldn't help but raise his hands and cheer:\n\n"Finally!"\n\nZhang Wei sighed helplessly: "Three twenty, you can finally fall asleep tonight, right? "\n\nBut Zhou Hang has already opened the next game. This time he chose the heavy "Wing Loong-10" stealth drone. This latest model requires a lot of skill points to be unlocked before it can be used in the game. It is said that its control interface is a 1:1 replica of the real model.\n\n"It's worth it to serve in the cyber prison for the People's Air Force!""
  prcs.18.a: "Zhou Hang muttered, and took off again to defend the virtual blue sky of the motherland."

  prcs.19.t: "Last year at this door"
  prcs.19.d: "At eight o'clock in the morning, the peach branch was reflected on the blackboard through the window in the front row, slowly sliding into the narrow gap of the chalk slot and mixing with the dust accumulated last year. Teacher Fang was preparing a lesson plan and writing comments under the column of necessity, unaware that the peach blossom had climbed up the corner of his pants. The peach branch turned away from the unfaithful man and went to play with the floating dust in the corner. As the class became more and more noisy, Teacher Fang couldn't help but look up. It didn't matter if he didn't look, but he was immediately furious when he saw it. Some were chatting, some were playing with airplanes, some were sleeping... It was a mess. Teacher Fang opened his mouth and was about to say something, but was interrupted by the sudden bell for class.\n\nAs the bell ended, Teacher Fang looked at the quiet students and didn't want to say a word. Frosted eggplant? Maybe, at least it was still more energetic before class, Teacher Fang comforted himself. Turning around to write down the lesson to be taught today, Teacher Fang said to the students: "Today let's talk about the necessity of self-revolution. "\n\n"I believe that the students have prepared carefully before class. Now let's pick a student to ask a question. "Before Teacher Fang finished speaking, the atmosphere in the class suddenly became solemn, and Taoying shrank under the desk and trembled.\n\n"Is there anyone who volunteered? ... In this case, the sleeping student..." The snoring person was poked by the elbow next to him unconsciously, and even Taoying beat the person's feet madly. "...The student next to him will answer."\n\nAs soon as the voice fell, the class seemed to have returned to the heat first, and then fell into a colder abyss, and Taoying froze behind the chair. "I... I don't know, teacher, I need to read a book first."\n\n"That's right, wake up the student next to you." Teacher Fang looked at the students and said slowly: "Recognize your own problems, and make changes, grow in the negation of negation, and thus develop in a spiral upward. Dialectics tells us that the fundamental reason for the development of things lies in the contradictions within things, and self-revolution is our way to jump out of the historical cycle. "The students focused their attention on the classroom, and the peach branch was having fun pretending to be the blush on the students' faces.\n\n"Let's have a free discussion later, let's go to class now."\n\nThe face of the man and the peach blossoms are red\n\nThe face of the man is unknown\n\n"The fundamental reason for the development of things lies in the contradictions within things..." The peach branch was doing morning exercises on the eyelashes of the students, and Teacher Fang was concentrating on the class. Brother Elbow elbowed Brother Sleep again, "What are you doing?" Brother Sleep turned his head, and the peach shadow fell on the back of his head and stuck to the tip of his hair.\n\n"What do you think the internal contradiction is?" Brother Elbow said, he felt that the peach branch reflected on his face was a little dazzling. "It's definitely not you poking me now, this is obviously an external contradiction. "Shui Ge was obviously still upset about the elbow strike just now. A gust of wind blew, and Tao Ying was facing the two bad guys fighting in a ball, and she didn't notice that she had been moved. "My two classmates, now is not the time for free discussion, why don't you two go to the stage to speak?" The two were chatting when suddenly their eyes went dark, and Teacher Fang just walked to their side.\n\n"... The free discussion will start with you two." Teacher Fang returned to the stage...\n\n"Let's have a free discussion now." The audience was quiet at first, and then it became intense, waking up Tao Zhi who was sleeping on the top of the students' heads.\n\n"You need to have a collection of wrong questions, and you can find problems only by sorting them out frequently." This was what Elbow Ge said. "It's better to write more self-reflection, self-reflection is the most important." Shui Ge obviously disagreed. "You stayed up past one o'clock last night, and the self-reflection you wrote would only say that your learning attitude is not correct. "This is the roommate who shared the dormitory with Brother Shui." "Sleeping late can't be called staying up late, how can students' affairs be called staying up late?" Then there were things like "turn off the lights at 10 o'clock" and "it's better to clean up after being late", which made the students around laugh. "Don't forget that students have to evaluate each other during our monthly exams." "We must also take self-revolution as a kind of self-consciousness..." Teacher Fang added.\n\n Taozhi ran to the lesson plan, and her footprints just covered the words "two complete breaks" circled in red pen."

  prcs.20.t: "People in the apricot forest"
  prcs.20.d: "Doctor Zhang had just seen off the last patient of the morning when he collapsed in a chair from exhaustion. It was already noon, and he didn't want to touch the lunch box his wife had prepared. He just wanted to lie down in a chair and rest for a while. As the only doctor in several nearby villages with nearly thousands of people, he really felt exhausted.\n\nHe used to be very tired. Occasionally, a few nearby villagers would come to him for medical treatment, but when he walked in those villages, he could still often see children with high fever being wrapped in swaddling clothes by their mothers with ginger slices applied to them, and elderly people with enteritis vomiting and diarrhea while drinking Coptis chinensis water. So he could only take the initiative to find those patients and provide them with free medical treatment. Prescribe them medicine at cost price. But some villagers either can't afford it or are more superstitious about their own prescriptions. \n\nHowever, in the past few months, he has been busy here, and the clinic has become lively. After all, seeing a doctor is cheaper, and the recent free clinics have helped the villagers popularize a lot of medical knowledge, and more people are still willing to come to him for treatment. Although it is said that there is no need to take the initiative to go to the village, it is inevitable to be tired. \n\nDoctor Zhang walked to the empty backyard, looked at the apricot tree planted behind the yard, and lit a cigarette for the first time and started smoking. "It would be great if someone could help me share the pressure of seeing a doctor." He thought. \n\n"Is Doctor Zhang here?" Someone shouted at the door. \n\n"Please sit down first, fellow villagers, I'll be there soon." He threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on the cigarette butt. \n\nWhen he walked to the reception desk and saw another man in a white coat standing there, he was immediately stunned. "
  prcs.20.a: ""Doctor Zhang, I am a new doctor, and we will be colleagues from now on.""
  prcs.21.t: "Thousands of people, thousands of faces"
  prcs.21.d: "Teacher Fang straightened his collar and walked quickly across the corridor full of flowers. His chest rose and fell, and he happily enjoyed the sweet and refreshing breath of spring flowers. The policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend on the cultural front allowed this young scholar to finally get rid of the stereotyped repetitive words in political books and teach students real thoughts and opinions, knowledge that is truly worthy of the name of the textbook "Thoughts and Politics".\n\nWhen the chalk dust fell on the multimedia podium, the May sunshine shone through the window lattice, sprinkling a breath of new life on the students' desks. Teacher Fang turned around and looked at the students with a smile: "Students, in this ideological and political class, we are going to talk about something different from the past. Let's break the old."\n\n"Break the old?"\n\n"Yes, break the old. In layman's terms, it is to criticize the poisonous weeds of our past. "Teacher Fang inserted the USB drive into the all-in-one machine, swiping the screen while smiling. "For example - practice is the only criterion for testing truth." \n\n"Students, look at this historical image." The red laser dot stopped on the worker wearing a red armband, "In 1932, workers at the British-owned tobacco factory in Shanghai went on strike. When they were testing the truth that 'strikes can fight for rights and interests' on the streets, the British consulate across the street was also practicing the truth that 'military suppression can safeguard colonial interests'. So what do you think, did they all practice it? ”\n\nSeveral students were speechless, as if they were thinking deeply, and some were furious, because this was completely different from the education they had received for so long. However, some understood and were quickly using the new version of the ideological and political textbooks to highlight the key points with fluorescent pens.\n\nThe slides continued to play, and the yellowed pages of Guangming Daily in 1978 and the bright red title of Mr. Wang Huning's report in 2023 collided on the screen. Teacher Fang's finger slid across the touch screen, and two photos split the solidified air like a sword-the left was a human wall built by striking workers in Shanghai during the epidemic, and the right was a silhouette of stock exchange elites ringing the bell in the stock exchange building.\n\n"Comrade workers, you are using practice to verify the truth that unity is strength, and capitalists are also using practice to verify the truth that capital never sleeps and only makes money without talking about the bottom line. If practice is the only criterion for testing truth, can we still say that truth is the only one? "\n\nThe classroom was filled with the sound of students flipping through books. Even the most naughty student in the corner was aroused by the current situation and listened to the class carefully.\n\n"Let's take a look at an interesting comparison." Teacher Fang slid the screen. The bar chart of the surge in grain production in Xiaogang Village in 1982 was juxtaposed with the video of drone sowing in an agricultural cooperative in 2023. "For the same yellow land, the practice of dividing land to households forty years ago created a miracle, and forty years later, the practice of land transfer is continuing its glory--" He suddenly enlarged the densely packed equity structure fan chart on the screen, "but why do the shares of agricultural production cooperatives all come from those large investment companies? ”\n\nThe coolness from the air-conditioning vents climbed up the back of the neck, and several students unconsciously straightened their backs. Several students who were best at ideological and political education felt that the education they had received was as pale and powerless as catkins - because that was not an education that spoke for their class.\n\n"When we talk about 'practice verifies truth', is it the workers on the assembly line who are testing it by working 12 hours a day, or the clinking of champagne glasses in the board office?" Teacher Fang suddenly raised his voice. "Hmm? Classmates? You are also children of workers, and your parents are also making a living in cramped offices, stuffy steel rolling workshops, and exposed fields. Classmates, please think about it, what truth are they verifying?"\n\n"Let's take one last example, the intensification of the global greenhouse effect. "Teacher Fang cleared his throat and glanced at the whole class with his peripheral vision - he was satisfied to see that the whole class held their heads high and followed his thoughts closely. "While developed countries are practicing 'environmental truths' with hypocritical carbon trading and relying on carbon emissions to patch up the gaps, the indigenous people of Tuvalu are using their flooded homes to 'practice' another truth - that excessive carbon emissions will really devour their country. "He tapped the outline of the island that was about to disappear on the screen, "That's why Marx said that mankind always only proposes tasks that it can solve. "\n\nThe spring breeze swept into the classroom with the fragrance of wisteria. This is the spring breeze of this era, the spring breeze of workers and farmers, the vast proletariat, and the spring breeze of those "neglected majority" who have lost their voice for decades.\n\nTeacher Fang threw half of the chalk head on the table in a chic manner, looking at the whispering students, he knew that he could no longer endure the students' eager discussion.

  prcs.22.t: "Catch the "Pig""
  prcs.22.d: " As the People's Liberation Army swept down several cities like autumn wind sweeping fallen leaves, the ordinary soldiers in the Taiwan puppet army collapsed at the first touch, and the morale of the army collapsed. Under the guidance of underground personnel, the defeated Taiwan puppet army surrendered to the People's Liberation Army in an organized manner. Due to the large number of surrenders, the PLA's advance troops could only confiscate their guns first, leaving a part of the backup troops to guard them, and the new recruit Cheng Gang was one of them.\n\n"Gangzi, the quality of these strawberry soldiers is really poor. We fired a few shots into the air and then threw our weapons to the ground and started to salute in French. Catching them is like catching pigs. It's just hard for the comrades in the receiving troops in the rear to adopt so many "pigs". "After dinner, my roommate Wei Xiang complained, "No, even if it's tens of thousands of pigs, it will take time for the comrades on the front line to catch them..."\n\n"Don't say it, I just delivered food to a puppet soldier, and he asked me how to eat guava." Next to him was the squad leader of the next class, Lao Zhang, "He cried and asked me how to eat a whole guava, saying that at home his mother would open it and remove the seeds before giving it to him." He sighed helplessly and tiredly.\n\n"Indeed, I heard that there was a leaf smoker at the second battalion commander's side. After being caught, he was addicted, drooling and snotting, begging for leaves." Cheng Gang answered, glancing at the prisoners squatting on the ground, and looking around vigilantly from time to time. "The comrades on the front line are fighting hard, and we should also do a good job. "\n\n"Crack" the sound of breaking branches reached the ears of several people.\n\n"Swish" several people raised their guns almost at the same time and looked towards the source of the sound\n\n A man in an unknown military uniform stood there in a daze. He repeated the action of holding the gun like a machine, but the pistol was not even unholstered. He was just doing it in vain.\n\n"Don't move, put down your weapon, and raise your hands." Cheng Gang said coldly, observing his every move. As long as the man had any abnormal behavior, he would shoot immediately.\n\nAnd Wei Xiang beside him had been on guard all around, his eyes like torches.\n\nThe man finally reacted, slowly raised his hands, and said in a trembling voice, "Jiang Can Shi Te Sha Su Na (I surrender, don't kill me)"\n\nCheng Gang frowned. He felt a sense of familiarity when he first saw this man. After hearing the voice, He was sure - that was his Japanese foreign teacher when he was studying in junior college. \n\n"Toyokawa-san, please calm down" he said in a strange voice. Then, he skillfully unloaded the foreign teacher's weapon. \n\nToyokawa was trembling, and kept muttering "Shasana-ide (Don't kill me)", while Cheng Gang, who was guarding him, was wondering why he was here. \n\n "Student Cheng Gang, I'm going back to China to join the army. Please take care of yourself and hope to see you again in the future." Recalling the parting words of Teacher Toyokawa several years ago, a chill rose from his feet to his head. He stopped Wei Xiang and said, "He is a member of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. The devils are interfering with our unification. Report it quickly! "After speaking, he took a breath and looked at Wei Xiang to report the situation.\n\n"Report to the battalion commander, Japanese Self-Defense Force infantry has been found, requesting support and interrogation.

In the past 10 years, there has not been such a big change. 10 years ago, people were impressed by the bustling pedestrian street with huge crowds of people. And 10 years later... it has become a "cyberpunk" city.\n\n Chongqing used to have no shortage of high-rise buildings, but in the era of large-scale infrastructure, the planning of building a giant business district has added icing on the cake for this mountain city. After the seaweed, the central government quickly gave Chongqing construction planning guidance, saying that the goal is to move towards a futuristic city. . Soon, this place became a state-owned business district. The night covered Chongqing with a veil, and the steel skeleton of this mountain city became clearer in the dark. The skyscrapers lined up like giants under a spell, piercing the sky between the mountains. The glass curtain walls reflected the neon light, stirring the stars and the lights of the world into a dazzling vortex. The LED lights in several high-rise buildings flashed a few words, but unlike usual, what came into view was "Salute to the People of Chongqing". Xiao Zhang was surprised.

What was most puzzling was that among these people sat an old man who was older than many of the people present. His face no longer showed the restlessness of his youth, leaving only a pair of calm eyes.\n\nThe conference room was silent for a while, and it was Hu Chunhua who first broke the state: "Comrades should have discovered that our 20th National Congress has elected many new faces, but also many old soldiers, which reflects both a new look and steady progress.

If the President is diligent in governing, the Premier will handle foreign affairs. In General Secretary Hu's reform plan, it is necessary to concentrate on major events in the future, so the comrade who succeeds the position of Premier must be experienced, strong and able to convince the public. Therefore, the image of an old predecessor emerged in his mind.\n\nComrade Wang Zhaoguo, one of the members of the Political Bureau during the era of former President Hu Jintao, during the era of Hu Jintao, he headed the Federation of Trade Unions of the People's Republic of China and made a series of correct judgments on economic development. He is not only outstanding in ability, but also quite left-leaning in politics.

We should make a careful choice.\n\nThe candidate proposed by the Political Bureau is Comrade Le Yucheng. He represents the conservative and harmonious diplomatic trend within the party. He still supports the concept of peaceful development and opposes the concept of imperialist diplomacy. This moderate concept can help us win more trading partners, but it also limits our assistance to revolutionary brother countries.\n\nAnother candidate is Comrade Mao Yuanxin, a veteran revolutionary. He represents the radicals within the party. Although he is old, his revolutionary heart is still enthusiastic. Choosing Comrade Mao Yuanxin can greatly ease the differences in left-wing ideology within the camp, and we can also let go of exporting revolution.\n\nNow, after careful consideration, General Secretary Hu cast a key vote."

Obviously, although he and the new left have different political views, they still extended an olive branch to him, intending to win over the original "establishment left".\n\nAfter the meeting, Hu Chunhua stretched out his hand, smiled kindly and said: "Although we have different political views, we still have to be united, Comrade Huning."\n\nWang Huning hurriedly shook Hu Chunhua's hand, bowed his head slightly and said: "Maintaining the unity of the party is the life of the party, and we insist on implementing the resolutions of the Party Central Committee.

Minister Liu of the Municipal Party Committee Organization Department pushed the door open with a cup of hot tea in his hand.\n"Hello, Minister Liu, aren't you dealing with the Caojing Industrial Park? The orders caused by the American Civil War have fallen sharply, and at least one-third of the factories in the park are facing the risk of bankruptcy." Chen Mingyuan pointed to the data table on the computer screen and said, the red numbers in the table were shocking.\n"Our dependence on foreign trade is too high. The impact of this American Civil War is more serious than the financial crisis in 2008." Minister Liu sighed and put the hot tea in front of Chen Mingyuan, "Drink some tea, don't get tired. "\nChen Mingyuan nodded gratefully, but did not drink the tea immediately. He stood up and walked to the industrial distribution map of Jiaxing City hanging on the wall of the office.\n"Minister Liu, several colleagues and I have studied it for a week and feel that this crisis is actually an opportunity." He pointed to the dense factory marks on the map and said, "Although our GDP has grown rapidly in recent years, it is actually export growth in exchange for cheap labor and resource consumption. The actual income of the people has not grown synchronously."\nMinister Liu was a little surprised at the young man's outspokenness, but he motioned Chen Mingyuan to continue.\n"The American Civil War caused a cliff drop in orders, but the demand in the domestic market has actually been there. Our problem is that we have not established an effective domestic production and consumption circulation system." Chen Mingyuan took out a handwritten plan from the drawer, "We can take this opportunity to promote the transformation of the industrial structure."\nMinister Liu took the plan and read it carefully. "The core idea of ​​this plan is to organize enterprises that originally relied on exports and adjust production according to domestic market demand. The government does not simply provide subsidies, but takes the lead in establishing an 'industrial mutual aid consortium' to coordinate resource allocation and production plans. "Chen Mingyuan explained. \n"Does this sound a bit like a planned economy?" Minister Liu looked up and asked. \nChen Mingyuan shook his head: "Not exactly. This is a special form of organization in times of crisis, which retains the flexibility of the market mechanism but increases the government's macro-control efforts. The most important thing is that we must put the basic living needs of the people first, not market profits. ""

The core topic of the meeting was only one: how to guide the domestic public opinion field during the special period of implementing strengthened macroeconomic regulation and some planned economic measures.\nIn the conference room, two obviously different voices clashed.\nSome government representatives firmly stated: "Under the current situation, public opinion unification is the key to responding to the crisis. We need to focus on promoting the necessity and effectiveness of government regulation measures, reduce discussions on the slowdown of market-oriented reforms, and create a good public opinion environment for policy implementation."\nHowever, some think tanks and media representatives held a different view: "During the crisis, open discussions should be encouraged to gather wisdom from all parties. Excessive control of public opinion may lead to policy mistakes not being corrected in time, which is not conducive to the scientific decision-making of the government."\nAfter several days of meetings, the General Office of the Central Committee issued the "Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Public Opinion Work during Crisis Periods", which mentioned the main work direction of the media at present——"

These mechanisms should be retained and improved. The international situation is not yet completely clear, and we need to maintain macroeconomic control over key industries and resources. "\nHowever, representatives of the economic community and some ministries and commissions hold a different view: "Strengthening regulation is an expedient measure to deal with the crisis, and it should be withdrawn in an orderly manner as the crisis ends. Over-reliance on government regulation will suppress market vitality and affect long-term economic growth potential.

Mom and Dad no longer smiled and watched interesting short videos for her as before. Instead, they often frowned at the mobile phone screen or TV news, whispering words she didn't understand, such as "economy", "crisis" and "unemployment".\nShe hadn't had the bubble milk tea from the store downstairs for a long time. The note "temporarily closed" on the door of the store had faded a little. The park that she had promised to take her to before had become "wait until later". Even the sound of her mother telling her stories before going to bed at night seemed to be less energetic. She secretly heard her mother and grandma say during a video call: "... Save as much as you can, you don't know if your job is stable..."\nAlthough Xiaoya is still young, she can feel the worries of adults. She noticed that there were fewer and fewer snacks in the refrigerator, and her father no longer bought those "unnecessary" things online, and even the cake she usually had on her birthday was "forgotten". Once, she heard several classmates at school After talking about her parents being "laid off", she secretly looked up the term after returning home, and she felt like she had overturned a five-flavor bottle in her heart. Since then, she has learned not to clamor for new toys, and even pretends to forget that she wanted to drink milk tea. Xiaoya felt empty inside, but she didn't dare to ask too much, for fear of making her parents more worried. \nBut today, something seemed different. \nAfter returning home from school in the afternoon, Xiaoya was surprised to find that the pink sign of the milk tea shop downstairs was actually lit! Several older brothers and sisters in school uniforms were standing at the door, holding milk tea and talking and laughing. , the sound of the straw piercing the cup lid was "puff", very crisp. She hurried upstairs and saw her father busy in front of the computer for the first time in a long time, with the corners of his mouth slightly curled up. Mom was preparing dinner in the kitchen, humming the song she often listened to for the first time. \nXiaoya stood at the door, her heart beating faster. She noticed that the atmosphere at home was different, like the first ray of spring sunshine shining into the gloomy room. She was not sure what it meant, but she felt hopeful, just like in the fairy tales her teacher had told her, winter would always pass. \n"Mom! The milk tea shop downstairs is open!" Xiaoya shouted excitedly, with the cautiousness accumulated over the past few months hidden in her voice. \nMom turned around and smiled: "Really? Then when you finish your homework, Mom will order you a cup, okay? "\nXiaoya nodded vigorously, her eyes lit up. She wanted to ask her father if he had found a new job, why her mother was so happy today, and what those "stability" and "plan" meant, but she just hugged her mother tightly. She still didn't quite understand what those adult words meant, but she felt that the stuffy atmosphere at home seemed to be brightened by the lights of the milk tea shop downstairs.\nBefore going to bed at night, she secretly heard her father talking about "new government policies" and "job guarantees" on the phone, and his tone was much more relaxed than before. Xiaoya smiled secretly and fell asleep sweetly."

She was pleased to see that the lovely working people were protecting their right to live.\n"In order to deceive the central government, the former secretary concealed the number of people infected and reduced the supply of materials, causing complaints from the people, and they could not get timely help when they had symptoms." Chen Tinglan looked at the secretary firmly. "We can't do this."\n"You mean..."\n"Tell the central government, tell the media, tell the public." Chen Tinglan shook her neatly permed short hair, put her hands behind her back, and stared out the window. "Tell them the truth, there is concealment and false reporting of the epidemic in Shanghai...

When Chen Tinglan and several cadres in suits and leather shoes appeared, the crowd was stunned, and the flowing crowd froze here in an instant. The people in the front row looked at each other, wondering what the secretary meant by his appearance at this time. \nChen Tinglan smiled slightly and walked quickly towards the crowd: "Comrade, give me a red flag." \nJust like all fairy tales, the crowd burst into huge cheers, and the singing of the Internationale became louder and louder, and there was a little more confidence in it.

  prcs.37.d: ""You know, while you are gaining benefits for the company, you are also laying the foundation for your own beautiful life..." The team leader in the office began to use his official language and PUA language again, and wanted to get a satisfactory answer from these new recruits - be loyal to the company and use them at will.\n"Leader, it's like this. I want to ask, I talked to HR before joining the company, but I still want to confirm with you whether there is an overtime culture in our company." A newcomer raised his hand and asked, interrupting the leader who was still talking. He obviously didn't expect that these newcomers would ask him questions in return. After being interrupted, it took him a while to react, "What did you say? Overtime? Ah, our company does have overtime now, but it's rare. "\n"You dare to say that, damn it. "You cursed a few times in your heart, but you haven't come to the point of standing up. After all, you are afraid of losing this job. In addition to the environment, it is more about your age. You can only look at the questions raised by these newcomers, and expose the reality of "human blood steamed buns" little by little. "Excuse me, can your company guarantee the rest time on statutory holidays and whether it has an overtime compensation mechanism?" "Does your company have corresponding medical compensation after employees are sick?" "If employees are in the company..." Each of the series of questions they raised hit the hearts of you old employees, so you also stopped what you were doing, and saw that the arrogant leader on weekdays also blushed and yelled. "It's not you who chose the company, but the company chose you! You are responsible for what you say!" His roar wanted to interrupt the newcomers' thoughts and let you old employees see the facts and who is the leader. "If the company chooses us, then we should also know more about our next work and colleagues, so isn't it for a better company for us to ask first? You are right, leader. "The newcomer was obviously not affected and said everything he thought, which made the leader confused and angry. He said a few words and asked everyone to go back to work.\n"Lao Liu, this is the smartest among the newcomers. You are the best old employee in our company. I will hand him over to you and let him get familiar with his work content as quickly as possible." After the leader sent you this message, he pushed a business card with a cute puppy head to you. You couldn't help but smile. After adding him as a friend, you took him to understand the work content and precautions, and also pulled him into various work groups and chat groups in the company. However, on the first day, the leader sent annoying messages in the work group.\n"Everyone stay today to hold a welcome party for the newcomers and complete the remaining tasks in one go."\nBefore you complained, the newcomers in the water group couldn't help but start discussing.\n"Why do we have to work overtime on the first day? What should we do?" "I don't know, but it doesn't look like a good thing."\n"It seems like they are using us as a shield. "You feel that these newcomers are so quick-witted, but after seeing the message sent by the newcomer you led, you feel a little confused.\n"Brother Liu, if there is nothing else tonight, I will go back first."\n"Nothing else, won't you stay for a welcome dinner tonight?"\n"No need, I'll go home to eat, there are people waiting for me at home."\nThis sentence touched your heart at once. Indeed, why don't you go home to eat, but stay in the company? It seems that going home has become a rest point, not a choice.\nYou have never been so shaken in your heart, but you still want to see other people's reactions before making a decision, so you raised your head and looked around at your workstation, and found that the old colleagues who were assigned to the newcomers were the same as you. They couldn't help but laugh together, chatted a few words in the water group, and expressed their position-this year, you don't plan to spoil him.\n"Leader, I have something tonight, I have to go home.

This also attracted the attention of the general manager. In order to let other departments and branches learn advanced experience, a group of study groups will be organized in the group to come and study in a few days.\n"You guys, when the time comes, I'll beg you to beg me, don't tell them about our company's overtime situation." Through the voice coming from the crack of the leader's office door, you unconsciously stopped and listened to the leader's persuasion to this group of newcomers.\n"But leader, this thing has already happened. Although we accepted overtime, we were also given the next vacation and compensation." Wait, haven't I been working overtime with them for the past few months? Why don't I have these things? The previous anger sprouted again.\n"I know, I know, but I hope you don't tell them that we achieved our results by working overtime and extending working hours. "It can be heard that the leaders are scared after these months of getting along. These guys not only have the skills, but also understand the law and how to use them.\nSeeing that the communication was fruitless, the leader finally had no choice, "Well, you guys can take a rest when the time comes, and let the old employees take charge of this event." Then he asked them to leave the office, and you took the opportunity to return to your workstation, followed by a message of "approval" from the leader.\n"Lao Liu, the headquarters will organize a study group to study with us in a few days. When the time comes, you can take those old employees to sort out our recent achievements. Remember, this time it concerns the status of our company, and we can't be careless. ”\nYou wanted to ask something else, but the long mechanical reply has helped you make a choice - "Received".\nYou slumped in your chair and thought about the things that have happened in the past few months. The small cards of encouragement posted by the newcomers on the door, the small plants raised in the office area, not to mention the smiles on their faces, made you feel warm and determined to write them into the report you compiled. Just as you were busy, the newcomer sent you a message.\n"Brother Liu, why don't you let us tell the headquarters when we already have overtime."\n"It should be for the company..." Before you sent this sentence, you quickly withdrew it and sent a new sentence "It should be for your good."\n"But I think it would be better to explain the situation, otherwise only we will have overtime benefits, which will cause confrontation between new and old employees."\n"It's okay, just suffer a little, and you will be able to get through it soon."\n"I don't think so, Brother Liu."\n"Then what do you plan to do.

It sounds interesting. Tell me more about it." The leader looked at you with interest. After all, these were not written down in the report.\nYou told him some things that the newcomers had never tried at work, and even gestured with your hands when you talked about things that made you happy, but you didn't notice that your eyes were shining when you talked about these people.\n"After listening to you say so much, I have become curious about these young people. Can I meet them? "You did not refuse the team leader's request. After confirming that they were all free, you dialed their video calls.\n"Brother Liu, I heard that the team leader was looking for me..."\n"Sir Liu, our time is precious... Well, I see..."\n"Want to know about our business? I just need to do what I should do well..."\nEvery time you dialed a person's video, the team leader liked this group of newcomers more and more. Finally, you dialed the last one, which is also your favorite newcomer's video call.\n"Hello, Brother Liu, ah, is this the team leader, hello, hello."\n"Don't be too nervous, I just can't stop listening to your brother Liu talking about you, so I'm curious about what magic you have."\n"Oh, it's such a team leader. Although our performance may make everyone shine, Brother Liu and his people still pay more, not to mention that they have not received overtime and vacation compensation."\n"What did you say? Overtime? I remember that the group decided to solve these problems not long ago. Lao Liu, tell me the truth, have you worked overtime? "\nYou didn't expect this kid to bring up this question at this time. Your head was dizzy, and you wanted to answer no instinctively, but then you bit your lip and nodded.\nYou told him about the unfair treatment you had received in the past few years without reservation. You didn't expect the team leader to help you, but after listening to what you said, he patted your shoulder gently, expressing his hard work. He also reported to the higher-ups that the abolition of overtime had not been implemented.\nThe learning exchange meeting ended quickly, but the problems you and the newcomers reported were obviously The headquarters took it seriously. A few days later, the headquarters sent an investigation team to check whether the employees' working and overtime hours violated the regulations, and also asked each employee whether there was a serious overtime situation. \nAt the subsequent group meeting, the investigation team first confirmed that the situation was true, and then started a "anti-overtime culture" reporting activity. The group also returned the various compensations owed to you in various welfare measures. Although you think the compensation is no longer important, you still left a thank you message on the young man's WeChat. "

Someone recognized it at a glance. It was "There is a Dead Deer in the Wild" in the Book of Songs. There was a burst of chuckles from the audience, and a slight voice: "Old Wei is also sexually repressed."\nThe corners of her mouth curled up: "Many of you are open-minded and know a lot of knowledge. Kollontai would be stunned in private. But when it comes to emotional needs, you become moralists. The unrestrained songs of our ancestors have become harsh in your ears. This is actually the steel stamp that those pseudo-Chinese studies have branded on your thoughts. How sad. "\nThese words rang out in the classroom like thunder. The smiles on some students' faces froze, some snorted contemptuously, and more looked at Guo Shaohua with resentment, wanting to hear what this "old witch" had to say.\nSeeing that everyone was looking over, Guo Shaohua smiled and began to talk nonstop: "The people of the pre-Qin period always bravely pursued beautiful feelings. Since the birth of Chinese civilization, there have been seeds of humanistic liberation. The free combination of men and women and equal status have been handed down from ancient times. Our people regard them as treasures and write them into the ballad era. "\n"Tang Wu's revolution liberated Chinese civilization from the rut of witchcraft, allowing people to commemorate their own exchanges and pursue the continuation of life from generation to generation. The so-called family is wrapped in the Chinese people's eternal pursuit of life. We are not here to create people, but life itself. "\n"Then, King Chen and others bravely rose up and swore with the roar of "Kings, princes, generals, and ministers, are you a kind of people?" that the lower class people of China are equal to the kings, princes, generals, and ministers, and there is no essential difference. They are human beings, they neither obey the heaven nor inherit destiny, and it is only by chance that they become rulers. "\n"These are the essence of our national studies." Wei Le finished speaking, then took a deep breath and continued to talk endlessly.\n"However, when we entered the feudal era, those intellectuals who surrendered to the kings, princes, generals, and ministers, they compiled the so-called Neo-Confucianism, the so-called preservation of heaven's principles and elimination of human desires, denied the most basic emotional needs and life pursuits of the people, but they spent their days in wine and women, and did all kinds of evil. "\n"The literati raised by the kings, princes, generals, and ministers maliciously refused to record the true feelings of the people, causing the people's precious native culture to be forgotten and destroyed. The long feudal era has trampled on the people for thousands of years, making us forget how to seek the eternity of life. Let us forget the roar of kings, princes, generals and ministers. "\n"After thousands of years, what can you remember when you mention Chinese studies? Nothing but the Three Bonds and Five Constant Virtues, nothing but etiquette, filial piety, integrity and shame, nothing but the morality of master and slave. The only thing is that there is no pursuit of beauty and life. Maybe there is still love, and there are still dreams of the Red Mansion and a song of the West Chamber, but now, love and lovers are just synonyms for lust.

He waved to the crowd, and the Shanghai watch on his wrist flashed in the morning light.\n"Comrades, I've been waiting for a long time!"

"Experts from the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences will be stationed here next week." Hu Chunhua turned to the accompanying cadres and said, "Agricultural machinery subsidies should be tilted towards breeders. "\n\nA sigh suddenly came from the corner. Hu Chunhua looked at a teacher sitting in the corner. He was absent-minded and dazed. Looking out the window, Hu Chunhua stood up and walked over, patted the teacher on the shoulder, and he woke up as if from a dream, "Little comrade, you are the teacher representative of the county here, why are you sighing?" "Prime Minister Hu, our county is short of teachers and teaching aids, but it has not been approved." After the teacher representative answered, he looked at Hu Chunhua with expectation. Hu Chunhua nodded, "After a while, the province will support you. If it doesn't come, you can call the province. This matter will definitely be put on hold."\n\nSeeing that the problem could really be solved, the worker representative Wang Jianguo stood up and was about to speak, Hu Chunhua suddenly asked: "Old comrade, the calluses on your hands are probably caused by the lathe, right?" Amidst the laughter of the whole room, the old worker raised his calloused hands: "Our county technical school is short of CNC machine tools..." "Okay!

Zhou Weidong stood up anxiously. "Don't panic," Hu Chunhua smiled, "I mean we should add another 300,000 to repair the branch canal." When the noon bell rang, the leader tore a page of paper from his notebook: "This is my phone number. If you encounter difficulties, come to me directly."

  prc_change.4.d: "Hu Chunhua looked around, and several faces were uncertain under the dim light. He cleared his throat, and the whispers around him disappeared instantly, waiting quietly for him to speak.\n\n"Everyone has seen it during this investigation." Hu Chunhua said, "The unemployment phenomenon outside is very serious, and it is almost threatening the social order."\n\nEveryone nodded silently. Everyone knows the impact of the epidemic on exports: the foreign situation has fallen into extreme chaos, and large numbers of foreign trade orders have become empty words. Many small factory owners woke up and found that the heads of foreign companies they had contacted with were either missing or in the morgue. The once prosperous Yiwu is now full of mourning, with companies with broken capital chains and workers who have been owed wages everywhere. The government is racking its brains to arrange the lives and work of these people, but it is undoubtedly a drop in the bucket in today's economic downturn.\n\n"We may be able to provide relief to these workers in a short period of time, but it will not last long. "Someone said, "There are only two solutions. One is to wait for the foreign countries to gradually stabilize and foreign trade to naturally recover..." He was interrupted: "Looking at the current international situation, is it still possible to stabilize?" This statement aroused a voice of agreement.\n\nHu Chunhua smiled bitterly: "Then we only have one way." He didn't say what it was, but everyone present knew it well. They nodded one after another, and their eyes became firm. Under the dim light, a plan was emerging..."

  prc_change.5.d: "Looking at the sunset outside the window, Hu Chunhua thought deeply for a long time. In his office, the heads of several key ministries had been sitting around for a long time. "Comrades," he said softly, "the current situation is clear to everyone." \n\n"The old leftists have been calling for reforms in recent years, and there are more and more new leftists among intellectuals." An official said, "They all oppose the current unfair distribution." \n\n"And those grassroots cadres," another added, "many people miss the spirit of serving the people in the past. Even in the army, there are many comrades who support change." \n\nHu Chunhua nodded: "It's time to unite these forces. We need a new united front to prepare for the coming changes." \n\n"But be careful," an old comrade reminded, "We must grasp the scale and not let the situation get out of control." \n\n"I understand," Hu Chunhua stood up, "This is a necessary change, for the people and for the survival of the party.

After deducting the necessary expenses, he only had 32 yuan left this month. His wife was at home in confinement after childbirth, and he lost his job three months ago. He used to have a monthly salary of over 10,000 yuan, but now he can only be frugal. Wearing a mask, he walked home with vegetables. Halfway through, he heard the sirens of police cars and the roar of the people on the next street. He didn't want to get involved, as his wife was still waiting for him at home.\n\n"Give me back my job!"\n\n"Give me back my salary!"\n\nThe sound of the horn echoed in the community, and he couldn't help but feel a little upset. He walked up the stairs and heard the sobbing of Sister Cui next door, and couldn't help thinking that she had also lost her job. He thought for no reason, "Maybe we are both wanderers in the world." But he couldn't provide more help. The powerlessness of government measures, the dying struggle of enterprises, and the free fall of the economy, he seemed to understand the neighbors who were marching outside."

The headline on the front page read "The Sixth Middle East War broke out, and Arab countries imposed an oil embargo." This mechanical processing factory, which had been struggling for nearly 30 years, was now struggling like a terminally ill patient. The workers' wages had been in arrears for almost three months; the remaining book funds were not even enough to pay for the materials. The loan from CCB was due next month. When the last old customer withdrew the order yesterday, he rubbed his hands and apologized, saying that the orders from the US market had been cut by 70%.\n\nHe sighed, recalling the ups and downs his factory had experienced: this factory had risen against the trend in the industrial winter of the Asia-Pacific financial crisis, and had also stood firm in the 2008 financial tsunami. But now, it has exhausted all its tricks and can't find a way out... Thinking of this, he gently slapped the bill in his hand on the table, and supported his head with his other hand.

Delegates from all over the country have left Beijing one after another, but the magnificent and solemn Great Hall of the People has not turned off its crystal chandeliers. This political ceremony can only be officially declared over when the newly elected 20th Central Committee completes its first agenda and elects the party leaders.\n\nWait until the day of the press conference. Facing countless camera flashes and shutter sounds, the seven members of the Central Standing Committee, including the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, walked on the red carpet and appeared to the world. Surprisingly, the former General Secretary Xi Jinping did not continue to be re-elected as speculated by countries around the world, but followed convention and gave up the throne of General Secretary to Hu Chunhua, the designated successor of the former leader of the Republic, Hu Jintao. Governments around the world cautiously congratulated Hu and waited with suspicion for the first step of the new leader, who was rumored to have close ties with the left wing of the Communist Party of China."

He raised his head and looked at the other members of the review team in the conference room.\n"This... uh, is this list okay? "His tone was the same as usual, without any change.\nThere was a moment of silence in the conference room. Everyone else in the conference room turned their heads away and didn't look at him. Only Wang Yang and the others looked around and glanced at him with a playful look.\nThe corners of his mouth twitched, and the piece of paper in his hand also trembled slightly. He glanced at the circle of people in the conference room. Except for the few guys who dared to look at him directly, the others just lowered their heads and didn't speak.\nHe nodded, let out a long breath, grinned, and gave Wang Yang a look with sparks in his eyes.\nFinally, Wang Yang spoke: "Comrade General Secretary, this list of the presidium was reviewed by us together, and there is no problem. There is no need to review it again. We have reviewed and passed it. "After saying that, Wang Yang lowered his head and raised the corners of his mouth.\nHe looked around the conference room for several times, and no one joined in. Everyone was just silent. The slogans in various mass incidents in various places, the remarks attacking him on the Internet, and even the violent incidents that openly attacked the entire country and the party, all made the conference table where he was now constantly up and down. Although he was an experienced old captain, how could such a ship survive such a storm? He couldn't help but tighten the neutral pen used for taking notes.\n"Since this is the decision made by this group now, I can't interfere." After a long silence, he finally spoke, but he looked around the conference room again: "The conference is a place for democratic decision-making. We will still make good decisions in a democratic way. Since we want to engage in intra-party democracy, we must do it well, right? "\nBefore waiting for others to agree, he raised his hand to stop these people, and then waved his hand."

  prc_change.10.d: "The secretary was sitting in the passenger seat, holding his briefcase tightly. The Red Flag car was shuttling through the rainy streets of Beijing. When the car passed the intersection of Wangfujing Street, he looked over there. At this time, there were only a few people wandering around the crowded Wangfujing Street. He glanced back at the chairman sitting in the back seat. Chairman Xi just turned his head and stared at something outside the window, but there was only thick fog outside. His fingers repeatedly rubbed the cap of a pen, sometimes squeezing the pen tightly, and sometimes scratching it with his nails. Wiping the pen, he did not notice his secretary. \nThe secretary leaned back again. The fog on the street was so thick that he could not see the road ahead. He looked at the unfamiliar driver and suddenly had a strange thought: "He won't take the wrong road, will he?" But he did not speak. He remembered that in the past, when the Commission for Discipline Inspection held a meeting, a group of people did not speak, but just stared at him silently. The secretary felt very thirsty, very thirsty, but he had just drunk water. \nAfter a long time, Xi Jinping spoke, still in that unhurried voice: "Where are Wang Yang and his gang?" \n"Report to the General Secretary, they are still on the way, there may be a traffic jam." The secretary was startled, but immediately answered. \nXi Jinping smiled contemptuously, and asked in that unhurried voice, "Where is Comrade Hu Chunhua?" \n"They said they are almost there, General Secretary." \n"I know." Xi paused, "Then where is Comrade Hu Ning?" \n"He is inspecting the preparations for the venue with other people in the General Office." \n"Not bad. You should take a rest first, lie down for a while, don't be too nervous. Don't be nervous, you will perform well later. "Xi said in an encouraging tone.\n"Thank you for your concern, General Secretary. I will do my best. "The secretary turned around and found that the chairman was no longer staring out the window, but put his hands in his pockets and looked straight ahead. The outlines of the towering monument and the memorial hall were barely visible in the rain and fog.\nThe secretary took a deep breath and lay down on the passenger seat. He was no longer interested in looking outside, it was just a piece of rain and fog. After a while, the car stopped steadily, and outside was a crowd of reporters and the solemn Great Hall.\nThe car door opened, and he still smiled confidently and kindly. "

The moon was hidden under the clouds.\nHu Chunhua had walked into this courtyard countless times, but it was the first time at such a late hour as today. After passing through several doors, they finally walked to the depths of the courtyard.\n"Comrade Chunhua, the General Secretary is waiting for you inside..." The secretary took him to one of the side rooms. Hu Chunhua took a deep breath, hesitated for a while, pushed open the door and walked in.\nThis reception room is not very large, and can only accommodate two or three seats. A rosewood coffee table is placed in the middle, on which are some tea sets and a porcelain plate with a few shaqi ma and glutinous rice noodles. Xi Jinping is sitting on the coffee table making tea, and no one else is inside.\n"Chunhua, don't be too restrained, sit down. "Xi Jinping still bowed his head and brewed the tea in his hand. Hu Chunhua hesitated a little, but still sat down slowly.\n"It has been difficult for so many years. The epidemic, the oil crisis, and the economic crisis are also pressing on our chests. "Xi Jinping brewed the tea and handed it to the opposite side, and Chunhua took it immediately.\n"With so many difficulties, it was under your leadership that we got through it..."\n"Without you, who else would give such great support?" Before Hu Chunhua finished speaking, Xi Jinping said this abruptly. A pair of sharp eyes stared at Hu Chunhua's face.\nHu Chunhua was stunned for a moment, but continued to speak: "The needs of the party are the needs of every party member. There is no support for party members. It is our responsibility to do things for the Party Central Committee. "\n"The greater the responsibility, the greater the ability; you know that our party is a place where talents are selected, and the greater the ability, the greater the burden to be carried. "\n"The general secretary is right, but our party is still a collective. No matter how big the burden is, it cannot be carried by one person. Everyone must work hard together, and no one will fall behind. Since everyone has contributed, then we should all share the benefits. "\n"Hehe..." Xi Jinping nodded, "A collective has a core, but it also needs a facade. If the facade is bad, it is still not good for the collective..."\n"General Secretary, we have tried our best. The black swan incident in the United States is such a big thing that it is rare to see in a century..."\n"Comrade Chunhua, don't be so modest." Xi Jinping sat upright and said seriously, "This is a very serious matter. Someone must be responsible for it, and there can only be one person."\n"You know, we are just born for the party, and we are always tied to the party. If we can't follow the will of the people, it will damage our party itself."\n"You helped me a lot in the past few years, and now the party has a new task for you." Xi Jinping finished speaking in one breath, looking directly at him, "This burden is heavy, can you bear it?"\nHu Chunhua pondered for a moment and said firmly: "

  prc_change.12.d: "When the list of election results was slowly read out, Wang Yang's smile gradually solidified and twisted, and the corners of his mouth that were about to open twisted together. The laughter got stuck in his throat and turned into an indistinguishable mutter.\nHe stared at the representatives with bloodshot eyes, and looked around with a trembling head, but he could not see anything, only darkness, and those teeth bared in the darkness.\n"Comrade Wang Yang, are you feeling unwell? "A faint voice came from the darkness.\n"No, it's not... impossible..."\n"This is the list we have collectively reviewed, there can't be any mistakes..." Wang Yang was about to speak, but this very familiar sentence blocked his mouth.\nSlowly, a person emerged from the darkness, a Hubei native, a man who became the governor at the age of 27, a man who stood out in this meeting, and a man with whom he had a close personal relationship. The man sighed, shook his head, covered his mouth with his hand, and moved his eyes to the other side. For the first time, Wang Yang felt a deep shame, a shame of being betrayed.\n"You...you guys...impossible, it's such a great opportunity...traitors..." He murmured, breathing heavily, dormant for many years, forbearing for many years, hiding his strength for many years, but today he was defeated and got nothing. He just felt a fire suddenly burning in his heart, burning his internal organs.\n"Comrade Wang Yang, the CPPCC is also a vast world, do a good job. "After a dizzy spell, Hu Chunhua shook him, patted his face gently, and fed him some water, which at least put out the fire in his stomach. He finally struggled out of the darkness, rubbed his eyes, and the world in front of him regained color. He no longer looked at his friend beside him, but looked at Chairman Xi standing on the rostrum."
  prc_change.12.a: "On the stage, Xi Jinping and Wang Yang looked at each other for a moment. The Chairman still had a deep gaze, but just smiled contemptuously."

  prc_change.13.d: ""Comrades, first of all, thank you all for coming together for this grand event," Xi Jinping walked to the podium and began to deliver his closing speech as the applause gradually died down: "Then, I also thank you all for your efforts and struggles over the past two years, which have enabled our country to finally defeat the epidemic, control the oil crisis, and stabilize the financial crisis. You have always united under the banner of the Party Central Committee, forged ahead courageously, and made great contributions and sacrifices. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, I would like to express my most sincere thanks to you. "After saying this, he bowed deeply to all the party members.\nAt this moment, the applause was thunderous.\nHe talked about many things: targeted poverty alleviation, rural revitalization, common prosperity, new development concepts, comprehensive deepening of reforms, the fight against the three major crises, and most importantly, the whole world has entered an era of great changes that have not been seen in a century due to the American Civil War.\n"On the other side of the ocean, the United States has accumulated social contradictions to an unprecedented level due to its long-term structural injustice in economic development and rigid political mechanisms. The Republicans and Democrats and the interest groups behind them have taken advantage of their internal social contradictions and launched a bloody civil war in order to realize their own political interests, dragging the American people into a dark era and greatly weakening the national strength of the United States. The American Civil War also reminds us all the time with bloody facts that we must comprehensively deepen reforms and must take people's livelihood and well-being as the foothold of economic construction. But the most important thing," he paused, and when everyone's eyes were focused on his face, he continued: "The most important thing is that our ruling party must always take unity and stability as the foundation of politics. Our party cannot lose its footing, and must always take maintaining basic social stability as the basic principle. "\n"In such a turbulent era, I am honored to fight side by side with you. But the party needs a new look. This is the requirement of the party, the people of the whole country, and the requirement of history. But no matter what team it is, no matter who leads it, we still have to stride forward with full courage and absolute confidence, not taking the wrong path, not taking the crooked path, not taking the old path, not fearing any difficulties and obstacles, for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, for the Chinese people, and for the history of China, hand in a full score answer sheet. "\nAfter speaking, he put down the manuscript, raised his head, and said with a momentum that swallowed the mountains and rivers: "The road is long and obstructed, but no matter what, the Chinese nation must be liberated and China will prosper! "\nAll party members stood up at the same time, and the overwhelming voice rang out throughout the hall:"

  Chihong.1.desc: "Park Wenxiu held his gun cautiously, crouched down and walked to a car at the entrance of the village, looked at the center of the village cautiously, and found that the center of the village was empty. There was no sound in the whole village, only the wind from the mountains was blowing. There was a faint smell in the air, and it was hard to tell what it was.\nAfter observing for a long time, the village was surprisingly quiet, without any human voice. Then Park Wenxiu called out to the back and whistled. Hearing the whistle, a PLA soldier emerged from the grass on the hill. He skillfully moved to Park Wenxiu's side. He whispered in Korean: "Are you sure it's safe here? Park Dongji? I didn't find too many devils up there." Park Wenxiu nodded and said, "No problem, Wu Chengren Dongji. I grew up here and I'm very familiar with it. My father occasionally comes home, and he doesn't see anyone on weekdays. The fat pig doesn't want to give us more wages. But my mother is very powerful. She not only feeds me, but also my twin sisters. "While Wu Chengren was muttering, he stood up and strode into the village.\nThe village is made up of a row of houses that form a circle. These houses surround the village square. In the center of the square grows a lush tree. Usually the villagers gather here, but the square is very deserted at this moment. There are footprints everywhere on the ground. Only a colorful ball can be seen rolling alone on the ground. Wu Chengren walked under the tree and found a row of children's shoes that girls would wear neatly placed under the tree. The smell seemed a little obvious, a bit like the smell of rotten eggs.\n"Wu Dongji, come to my house quickly and eat something, otherwise we will not be able to catch up with the troops, and then we will miss the time to fight the Japanese devils. "Park Wenxiu's voice came. He was already standing at the door of his house. Wu Chengren followed immediately. Park Wenxiu pushed the door open and walked in while calling his mother in Korean. But no one answered. So Park Wenxiu went to the side room and asked Wu Chengren to sit down first, and he went to see if there was anything to treat him. But when Wu Chengren walked into the living room, he found a dining table in the middle of the living room. The tatami mats were piled up together, and the table was There were several dirty dolls, the stains on them had dried for a while and were crawling with flies. The smell of rotten eggs in the air became stronger and stronger, and even a burnt smell could be smelled. \nPark Wenxiu came out of the wing room, holding a pot of still warm soup. He walked into the living room, muttering that his sister at home was really ignorant, while setting up the tatami. Then he asked Wu Chengren to sit down first, served the soup, and brought it to Wu Chengren. \n"My mother is the most diligent and cooking woman in this village. I like her broth the most. Today's soup is still hot, but it smells a little wrong..." Park Wenxiu suddenly found something wrong. He saw Wu Chengren's face pale and pointed to a piece of something in his bowl. \nPark Wenxiu took a look and saw that it was a piece of finger, slender and short, like a child's finger. "

He saw a pile of naked bodies lying in a mess next to a well in the backyard of a house. He immediately turned his head away. Park Moon-soo ran while shouting, "Follow me, follow me, I know where the folks are, I know! Wu Dong-ji, don't lose me!" "He pushed aside the branches like crazy, crossed the ditch in the mountain, and went down to the river. He didn't even notice that the reeds cut his face. Wu Chengren followed very hard. He wanted to vomit, but he couldn't.\nFinally, they ran to a cave covered by bushes. There were messy footprints in front of the cave. Fortunately, there were no military boots. So Park Wenxiu plucked up the courage and stuck his head into the cave. The sound of the bolt clicked immediately rang, and the bayonet was against his face. Wu Chengren followed closely behind, looking back from time to time.\n"Who! ?" This rude Korean language echoed in the cave.\n"It's me, Park Wenxiu, and I brought a PLA. "\n"Ah, Park Qinyong... and China Dongmu..." The leading guerrilla put down his gun.\n"My mother, is it okay?" Park Wenxiu asked anxiously.\nThe guerrilla suddenly turned his head to the side and didn't speak. "Are you okay...? "The guerrillas still did not speak, but just pulled Park Wenxiu to the depths of the cave.\nThe depths of the cave were crowded with all kinds of women and old people. When Park Wenxiu appeared, the crowd burst into a chaotic cry. "Wenxiu, poor baby..." "What a sin..." He walked towards the center of the crowd. The crying villagers took the initiative to make way for him. The dim flashlight gradually pointed to the "person" lying on the bed in the deepest part of the cave. The person's whole body was black, and a burnt stench came.\nAs soon as Park Wenxiu saw the person's face, he collapsed and knelt down, his voice began to tremble: "Mom..."\n"My son...my son...Mom's hand is broken, and I can't make soup..." Park Wenxiu's mother was burnt all over her body, and her clothes were torn into pieces. The pieces of cloth were strangely stuck to the wound, the ears were hard, the two lips had disappeared, and only the two eyes could move. \n"My son.....Mother is useless...Mother failed to save...sisters...Taeyo...those beasts...when they saw...your sisters...they wanted...then they were..." Park Wenxiu's mother couldn't say anything more, she couldn't go on. \n"Beasts...Wenxiu's mother was just protecting her two sisters, and was dragged to the backyard by Taiyo's soldiers, doused with gasoline, and burned to death...Wenxiu's two sisters also..." The guerrilla said this and began to sob. \nPark Wenxiu fell back to the ground, covering his ears with his hands. He felt a tearing headache. "

We must do something, or find the troops and let them come to resettle the villagers. Cheer up, Auntie is just burned. If we can find antibiotics, we can save Auntie's life. If we can find a team, it would be even better. In any case, we can't stay here any longer. Move, Park Dongji!" As he spoke, Wu Chengren took out his gauze and carefully bandaged Park Wenxiu's mother. Then, he handed the coagulant, cardiotonic, antibacterial ointment and morphine to the guerrilla and explained the use of the medicine.\nPark Wenxiu took two deep breaths and stood up with gritted teeth.\n"Armani, Mom, hold on, your son will definitely come back. After the war, your son will cook for you. Your son will cook for you for the rest of his life. "After that, Park Wenxiu and Wu Chengren walked out of the cave together. Behind them, the villagers looked at them sadly, watching them plunge into the bushes and disappear in the reeds.\nThey walked towards the front line for several hours, occasionally hearing the whistling of missiles, the sound of tank engines, the sound of guns and fighter planes passing by, but these sounds collided with the mountain and disappeared immediately. In the distance, a few white cranes could be seen flying across the sky.\nThey didn't know how many villages they had passed. Those villages were either filled with smoldering ruins or filled with all kinds of corpses in the village square. When they approached those villages, men and women, young and old, were hanging on the telephone poles on both sides of the village roads. He They were all barefoot and were arranged from oldest to youngest. They saw a bloody baby body hanging upside down on a telephone pole. Various crooked words were written on their bodies in Japanese, and some of the bodies were written in Korean: "Red Element", "Disloyal Mob", "I Offended Democracy", "I Slandered Freedom". Wu Chengren finally couldn't help it and vomited violently. Park Wenxiu just gritted his teeth, didn't look at those things, and continued to move forward. \nWu Chengren saw that in front of a burning school, a little girl covered in blood was dragging a torn rooster doll, standing in front of the fire, motionless. \n"Little friend, I am a Chinese uncle. It's very dangerous here. Let's go quickly. "Wu Chengren pulled the little girl.\nThe little girl didn't move, and murmured something, but Wu Chengren didn't hear it clearly.\n"Armani... Armani..."

They left a little food and left in a hurry.\nOn the way, Park Wenxiu just pulled Wu Chengren faster and faster. They took a very rugged mountain path, which would lead them directly to a small market town in the area, where they might be able to find the medicine and food they needed. They ran desperately in the dark night, and the moonlight was already obscured by the black smoke rising from the horizon.\nFinally, at dawn, they finally arrived The small market town was only slightly larger than the previous villages, but Park Wenxiu told Wu Chengren with certainty that there must be medicine there. \nThey hid their guns and military uniforms and crawled all the way to the yard of a house outside the market town, and then they knocked on the locked door of the yard. But there was no sound from inside, so they continued to knock persistently, and suddenly a baby cried inside, but the baby's cry was immediately covered. \n"Fellow villagers, don't be afraid, I am the Korean People's Army, Park Wenxiu, and I also brought a Chinese Dongmu, we are good people. "\nPark Wenxiu said in a low voice. After waiting for a long time, he heard a heavy sigh from inside, and the locked door opened a little, revealing a bloodshot eye. The eye looked them up and down for a long time, and then the door opened a little wider, beckoning them to go in quickly.\nThey walked into the living room and saw a woman with shriveled breasts and a pale face sitting on a ball of dirty rotten cotton wool, trying her best to comfort the baby in her arms, but the baby sucked the nipple hard, but could only suck out blood.\n"What do you want?" A one-eyed old man looked at the two soldiers in front of him haggardly, and looked at them repeatedly for a long time, "Where are your guns? Forget it, tell me what you want, I don't have much at home. "\n"Old man, we just want to borrow your clothes. My Armani was burned by the Japanese with gasoline. I have to find some medicine for her here, but entering the market town in military uniform..." Park Wenxiu explained eagerly.\n"Do you know what you are doing?" The one-eyed old man stared at them fiercely, "I have lived for more than 80 years. I have seen Japanese devils, American devils and the second devils in the south. I have seen their methods too clearly. More than 80 years ago, just because my uncle accidentally bumped into a Japanese devil, he let his lackeys drag him naked into the ice and snow, wrapped him with a piece of iron sheet, and then peeled off the iron sheet an hour later. More than 80 years have passed, and they are still like this. "\n"The brutal nature of Japanese imperialists..." Park Wenxiu was about to continue.\n"Since you know this, why do you still come in openly? If you are followed by a large team, then we welcome you, but now there are only two of you.

The one-eyed old man stuffed two civilian clothes into their hands, "Find the medicine as soon as possible, don't delay, your Armani is waiting for you, go!" \nBefore leaving, Wu Chengren quietly left a nut energy bar for the woman. The woman just stared at him blankly, without any expression, two tears running down her face."

  Chihong.5.t: "Withered Clinic"
  Chihong.5.desc: "After a while, they found the town clinic. The doctor in the clinic had disappeared. Only a dozen old and young women and children were left hiding in the clinic. They huddled in the drip room, motionless. Under the guidance of these refugees, Park Wenxiu and Wu Chengren found the medicines they needed. They left an IOU on the doctor's desk, stating what medicines they had taken, the unit number they were in, and stated that if they couldn't find them, they should go to the village committee to show the IOU. Just as they were about to retreat, a noisy sound came from outside the door. A chaotic Japanese song mixed with the roar of the engine rolled in from outside the town. The refugees were all in panic, and some of them were sobbing.\nPark Wenxiu immediately ordered the refugees to lie down, slowly crawl to the back door, and escape from there. Wu Chengren quietly lay on the windowsill to observe the situation.\nThose too The soldiers were obviously completely disorganized. Their uniforms and military caps were casually worn. One man wore a large military cap askew, and behind him was an officer dressed neatly, awkwardly. The Taiyue devils parked their cars in the town square and rushed into houses in groups of three or five. Wu Chengren saw several Taiyue people rushing into a house with lewd smiles, and then a half-grown girl ran away from the house. However, she fell to the ground after running a few steps when she was grabbed by the hair by the Taiyue soldiers who followed behind. Then they dragged the girl by the hair and dragged her to a place where they could not see her. The girl's heart-wrenching screams immediately disappeared in the lewd laughter, gunshots, screams, baby cries, and engine sounds. \nA dead body was tied to a Taiyue jeep. The body was stripped naked like the other bodies. There was a sign stuck on the body: "I am a lowly Xian person. "The jeep was circling the highway of the whole town in a show of strength. The driver drove the car recklessly over those who had just been pushed out of their homes and onto the street, humming an obscene song. He turned on the loudspeaker and started playing songs. Wu Chengren didn't hear the music played in the jeep clearly. It seemed to be a song from a girl band TV series he had seen before. The brisk tune was intertwined with the various "natural sounds" in the town. Several Taiyo soldiers ran out of the yard holding a baby. The desperate mother behind wanted to grab her child, but was grabbed by the waist and dragged into the house by the people behind. She struggled desperately to grab the door sill, so the Taiyo soldiers chopped off her entire palm.\nThen, several Taiyo soldiers saw the sign of the clinic from a distance, and began to scream strangely, holding their guns and rushing towards this side in a twisted posture. Wu Chengren cursed and rushed downstairs.\n"Park Dongji, run with the villagers! "Wu Chengren's face was distorted.\n"What about you?"\n"Don't worry about it!""

  Chihong.6.t: "The End"
  Chihong.6.desc: "When Wu Chengren was a child, he watched many movies about the massacres committed by the Japanese devils. He never really imagined what kind of horror his ancestors had experienced at the hands of the Japanese, nor could he imagine what the Nanjing Massacre was like.\nHe still remembers that when he was in college, he flipped through the Bible when he had nothing to do. When he turned to the Book of Revelation or some chapter, the lost lamb asked Peter what the end of the world would be like. Peter did not reveal anything too much, but just jokingly said: "Go and see for yourself." "And Wu Chengren saw all this with his own eyes now.\nHe was pushed by those sloppy Japanese soldiers in front of the well-dressed man and the sloppily dressed man. The sloppily dressed man looked him up and down and smiled evilly. Then he tilted his head, and the clerk with a crooked military cap behind him walked over with a flattering look on his face. Without waiting for the well-dressed man to give an order, the clerk immediately put on a ferocious expression and slapped Wu Chengren in the face.\n"The lowest and most inferior Chinese have fallen into our hands today! "The clerk suddenly spoke in fluent Chinese, but Wu Chengren just smiled contemptuously.\n"Yeah, I saw your bitch mother a few days ago, just as you said, shitting like a dog on the street of Caishikou. Now you are also like your bitch mother, shitting in front of your wild father in a lowly way, wagging your tail and begging for mercy to the living beast who came from nowhere, am I right?" Wu Chengren stared at the clerk and smiled, "Anyway, a wild dog like you will only live for a few days. When our World Liberation International Coalition arrives, you will be a wild dog without a home... Oh, no, I'm afraid you won't live to see that day..."\n"Fuck your mother's stinky Chinese, kneel down for me!" The clerk suddenly became furious and punched Wu Chengren in the abdomen with his fist, but Wu Chengren just spit in his face.\n"A wild dog, why is it barking here when its teeth can't even bite people? "\nThe clerk was completely enraged, and raised the butt of his rifle and smashed it towards Wu Chengren's knee. Although Wu Chengren was held by someone, he still hit him back with a headbutt. The clerk was a little dizzy, so the Japanese officer made a gesture, and the Taiyue soldiers who were holding Wu Chengren immediately knocked him down, held down his limbs, and rained down the butts of their rifles and military boots on him. His knee was smashed into a bloody mess.\n"You, you still want to stand up now? I tell you, in front of the lady, you are only fit to kneel! "The clerk wiped the blood from his nose and kicked Wu Chengren viciously.\nBut, to their surprise, Wu Chengren endured the severe pain and tried to stand up again. The clerk was completely furious, pressed Wu Chengren to the ground, and cut his tendons with a dagger. Wu Chengren's teeth were broken, but he didn't even groan.\nThe neatly dressed officer stepped on Wu Chengren's face with his boots and asked the clerk to take a photo of him with satisfaction. After taking the photo, he laughed and put the photo in his pocket. Then, he threw Wu Chengren to the Taiyue soldiers, letting them slowly experience the "trophy". The Taiyue soldiers rushed up with bayonets and began to cut meat from Wu Chengren. They scrambled for the cut meat and put it in their mouths."

  Chihong.7.desc: "The Taiyo soldiers drove all the living townspeople to the square, and then the jeep playing the girl band's music stopped in front of them. The clerk asked the townspeople to dance with him in awkward Korean. The Taiyo soldiers gathered in a circle and clapped along with the music. The frightened people didn't know what to do for a while and stood there unable to move. So a Taiyo soldier grabbed a helpless woman's hair and threw her forward, and the others rushed up and started beating her limbs hard, until the woman's bones could not be put together.\n"The rice cake needs to be beaten more, and the more it is beaten, the softer it will be! "The clerk laughed. Then, the Taiyue soldiers began to manipulate the woman's body like a puppet show, and performed an extremely terrifying dance. The people below began to riot, but the Taiyue soldiers picked out a few people, cut off their ears and noses, and stuffed them into their mouths.\nSo the remaining people were forced to dance to the music. One person danced to the wrong beat, and was beaten to death.\n"This is the spread of democracy and civilization, this is civilization! See, everyone is feeling the enlightenment of civilization! Such a conservative Xian people have also accepted the ritual and music civilization under our education! Those who don't understand will have to learn under our gun butts! "The Taiyue soldiers all laughed.\nWhen the music ended, the Taiyue soldiers were tired and threw the woman to the ground. The common people thought that it was over.\nBut they drove the villagers into the warehouse, including men, women and the elderly. As for the children, according to the order of the neatly dressed officer, they tied them up and threw them on the street. The mothers whose children were taken away screamed in collapse, but were immediately stabbed in the mouth by a branch by the Taiyue soldiers. The warehouse door was locked, and some people wanted to escape through the window, but were immediately hit by several bullets.\nThe Taiyue soldiers gathered in the warehouse Outside, a lot of things were thrown in. After a while, the smoke of white phosphorus bombs, the flames of incendiary bombs, and the flames of grenade explosions all appeared at the window of the warehouse. Before leaving, they filled the warehouse with gasoline and lit a fire. The flames rose up all of a sudden and engulfed the entire building in an instant. \nJust like when they came, these Taiyo soldiers drove over the children and disappeared on the road, and the noisy sound also went away with the dust of the car. \nAfter a while, a huge explosion rose in the distance, and short or long gunshots and intermittent commands also sounded. Screams, shouts for killing, and pleas for mercy were intertwined, but they also quickly died down. "

Other soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the Korean People's Army were standing guard. The two officers, one neat, with his cap gone and his collar open, stared at him with red eyes; the other, dressed in rags, lowered his head, not daring to let others recognize his face.\nA guerrilla pushed through the crowd and roared, "Why, do you want to send these beasts away so easily? Give them a bullet, is that it? Think about our village, think about so many folks?"\n"They are the Emperor's Guards, the Special Forces! It was these Japanese devils who set the fire, not me! I'm not Japanese!" The clerk explained in a panic.\n"Sit down! Sit! "Park Wenxiu held up his bayonet and pinned down the clerk. The political commissar of the People's Liberation Army walked up to the Taiyo prisoners and glanced at them. "Unit number, rank." The clerk suddenly seemed to have grasped a life-saving straw, stood up, pointed at the shabby Taiyo commander and said: "Sato Shinsuke, the 12th Detachment of the Ground Self-Defense Force Special Forces, he is the leader, all the orders were given by him." Then the shabby officer began to read a string of things in a low voice and quickly, and the clerk translated it: "He said he was just a victim of the war, he didn't want to hurt anyone, he said he was just a foreman of a company, but was forcibly conscripted. "\nBut the neatly dressed officer glanced at the sloppy officer with contempt, then pushed the clerk away and spoke in Korean: "Your genes and your bones are permeated with inferior factors. Not all nations are qualified to continue to survive in the modern world. Races like you deserve to be destroyed. Modern society does not need you believers in communism, nor does it need you nations that do not understand democracy and have not yet been enlightened by enlightenment."\n"Listen carefully." The political commissar said.\n"You inferior nations that spread the plague of communism are not qualified to survive. Our mission will be accomplished." The neatly dressed officer continued: "Even if we fail today, we will win one day."\nThe clerk's breathing suddenly tightened: "This is what they said, this is what they did, I was forced, I am innocent, I am on the same side with you, comrades..." His voice was already trembling.\n"You are not Japanese, then what the hell are you? A wild dog? "Park Moon-su roared.\n"They forced me to do it, they forced me! My hands are clean! Kill all these beasts, kill them all, but don't kill me!"\n"Then do it for us. Kill them all." The commissar said, and threw two barrels of gasoline in front of the clerk.\nThe clerk immediately rushed out with the others, and they started fighting. In the chaos, the clerk took the two barrels of gasoline and poured them on the heads of the Taiyo prisoners without saying a word.\n"Give me a fire, a fire, comrade! I will pay your blood debt for you!" He roared hoarsely.\n"Enough!" Park Moon-su unlocked the safety and fired at the beasts in front of him. The guerrillas also shot at the prisoners. "

Although he had rehearsed this scene countless times in his mind and even thought about how to escape, all of this would not be necessary today. Because he did not need to think about escaping today.\nThe people standing outside were not policemen in black uniforms, but all kinds of haggard people with simple clothes, including elderly people in their seventies and eighties, and children in their teens or even a few years old. He knew that these people were poor people with cancer. For many years, he imported anti-cancer drugs and sold them at low prices. They could not cure the disease, but they could relieve their pain.\nChen Que was a grassroots doctor. He had come into contact with too many patients and seen too many separations and deaths. But one day, a patient who often came to see him disappeared without saying hello, which made him feel very strange. Driven by curiosity, he found the patient's "home", a simple shack in the suburbs. Recycled garbage was randomly piled outside the door of the house, and the patient was wearing a yellowed backpack. The heart lay on the rotten cotton wool, groaning in pain. He looked at the prescription in his hand, looked at the astronomical bill, and finally lost the courage to go in. After that, he found a channel to buy cheap drugs, and when the time was right, he sold these drugs to the poor, sometimes even refusing to charge and distributing them for free. He knew that these drugs were not included in the procurement list and medical manual. Although these drugs can relieve the condition, it is undoubtedly illegal to sell drugs without official endorsement and supervision. \nFor so many years, he has protected the lives of those poor patients with these cheap drugs. He knows that this cannot cure cancer, let alone cure diseases deeper than cancer. But even if it changes a little, he will do it without hesitation. This is his duty. \n"Fellow patients, what is this..." Before Chen Que could speak, the patients bowed deeply. \n"Brother Chen, you don't have to worry anymore. We don't have to let you step into the fire pit for us anymore. We can buy these cheap drugs in the hospital." A patient took off his mask and squeezed out a smile: "Thank you for your care for so many years, Brother Chen. I won't bother you again in the future." After saying that, the patients bowed to Chen Que again.\nTwo huge tears rolled out of Chen Que's eyes. He knew that the day he had imagined countless times had come true. He was not a savior, he was just an ordinary person who accidentally carried a heavy burden.

This was the place where his grandmother had sung songs countless times when he was still in his infancy, and it was also the place where his grandmother had called softly countless times when she was in a coma with a high fever. When he was a child, his grandmother carried him on her back and stood on the Dandong Iron Bridge countless times to look at the other side of the Yalu River, but the sunlight from the east was too dazzling for him to open his eyes.\n"Wenqing, Wenqing, China treats us very well, you have to repay China and Chairman Mao; but I still want to go home and see the mountains, the water, and the rice fields there. "At that time, he was only five years old, and this sentence almost accompanied him for the rest of his life.\nIt was difficult for Park Wenqing to say how he felt after hearing that the Kim family was driven out of power, but he vaguely felt that the time for him to take his grandmother home was approaching; after the outbreak of the war against the Taiyo imperialist group, he joined the People's Liberation Army without hesitation and became an outstanding Korean fighter.\nBut when the war was over, when he walked to the quiet mountain village that he and his grandmother had been thinking about day and night, he didn't dare to go in. Why? Was he afraid of meeting acquaintances? Or was he afraid that his accent had become unfamiliar? Or was he afraid that he was alienated from his roots?\nHe took off his backpack, took out the urn, strolled in this quiet village, strolled in the mountains, looked at the newly built buildings painted in Chinese and Korean, listened to the children's cheerful laughter, and smelled the rice fragrance in the air. He suddenly felt very tired, very tired, but with it came a long-lost softness, as if he was still in the cradle."

As an old clerk who had worked in the archives of the county water conservancy bureau for 23 years, this was the first time he wrote down his evaluation of Deputy Director Wang on the cadre evaluation form.\nThe green ivy leaves on the windowsill rustled in the draft, and Zhang remembered the rainstorm last month, when the ceiling of the archives room leaked, and Deputy Director Wang rushed in with an umbrella to help transfer the data. The pen tip hung on the "mass base" column for a long time, and finally wrote a neat "good" character.\nWhen he got off work in the evening, Sister Li from the mailroom held up her mobile phone and stopped him in a hurry: "Zhang, look, the new sunshine notice board in the bureau!" The screen showed the travel expenses of each department this month. Sister Li pointed to one of the lines: "Lao Liu from the administrative department went to the provincial meeting with others. How come the high-speed rail ticket is more expensive than the plane ticket? "Then Lao Zhang raised the doubts on behalf of Sister Li at the morning meeting the next day. The chief financial officer blushed and stammered as he explained that it was a system input error.\nOn the winter solstice, the bureau held a "stove meeting" for the first time. In the temporary meeting room converted from the boiler room, more than 30 staff members gathered around the cast iron stove and listened to Xiao Lin, a new college student village official, talk about flood prevention plans. When he talked about forming a "silver-haired patrol team" in each village, Deputy Director Wang suddenly interrupted: "My father participated in the flood control in 1998. The old people are familiar with the river course. This is a good idea! "The coal in the furnace crackled and exploded with a few sparks.\nOn the day of the public announcement of cadre adjustments in the beginning of spring, the comrades in the archives room were busy submitting and summarizing the names of personnel. Old Zhang looked at the notice on the bulletin board that "Comrade Wang Jianguo was transferred to the consultant of the Flood Control Office", and remembered that at the previous democratic concentration discussion meeting, seven section members unanimously ticked "weak" in the column of "professional ability". The sun shines through the new leaves of the sycamore, casting a swaying spot of light on the notice paper. Nowadays, when passing by the office building of the unit, you can often see resident supervisors wearing red armbands. Last Friday, Sister Li pulled Old Wu, who was selling tofu in the vegetable market, to point in front of the notice board: "Look, the progress of the irrigation canal dredging that you reported last time, isn't this posted with the construction log?" After hearing this, Old Wu took out his mobile phone and opened the "Government Affairs Sunshine" APP, and couldn't help laughing: "Hey! I think the government's reform is good. It is much more efficient than before. If you didn't push it before, it would take you ten days or half a month..."\nWhen the autumn rain hit the glass window of the archive room, Lao Zhang was sorting out the newly arrived flood prevention ledger. The title page was sandwiched with a yellowed "Notes on Democratic Evaluation of Cadres", which was issued during the first evaluation half a year ago. He gently brushed away the dust on the pages. The sweet-scented osmanthus fragrance outside the window mixed with the smell of ink flowed quietly in the autumn light in the room."

He just wanted to lie down in a chair and rest for a while. As the only doctor in several nearby villages with nearly thousands of people, he really felt exhausted.\nHe used to be very tired. Occasionally, a few nearby villagers would come to him for medical treatment, but when he walked in those villages, he could still often see children with high fever being wrapped in swaddling clothes by their mothers with ginger slices on their bodies, and elderly people with enteritis vomiting and diarrhea while drinking Coptis chinensis water. So he could only take the initiative to find those patients and provide them with free medical treatment. , prescribe them a prescription at cost price. But some villagers either can't afford it, or are more superstitious about their own prescriptions. \nHowever, in the past few months, he has been busy here, and the clinic has become lively. After all, seeing a doctor is cheaper, and the recent free clinics have helped the villagers popularize a lot of medical knowledge, and more people are still willing to come to him for treatment. Although it is said that there is no need to take the initiative to go to the village, it is inevitable to be tired. \nDoctor Zhang walked to the empty backyard, looked at the apricot tree planted behind the yard, and lit a cigarette for the first time and started smoking. "It would be great if someone could help me share the pressure of seeing a doctor." He thought. \n"Is Doctor Zhang here?" Someone shouted at the door. \n"Please sit down first, fellow villagers, I'll be there soon." He threw the cigarette on the ground and stepped on the cigarette butt. \nWhen he walked to the reception desk and saw another man in a white coat standing there, he was immediately stunned. "

"Those young people wearing coarse cloth clothes and holding hoes in their hands joined the guerrillas after a few words from me and the village chief. I took them to travel all over the country, and they died in the jungles and valleys for the illusory ideals I talked about," the captain's voice became lower and lower, "I still remember the young man who always sang "The East is Red" in the newly learned Chinese, the man who wanted to save a piece of land for his unmarried wife, the boy who left his parents and wanted to make a name for himself, and the old soldier who joined the army again to repay his mother for a few hundred rupees of medicine money. \n"......"\n"I can't remember their names or their faces, I only know that after each ambush, the land behind me was dyed red. Time and time again..."

  Chihong.18.desc: "The raindrops dripped onto the ground, making a very subtle sound. I gasped, and the moisture from my breath slowly dissipated. The world seemed to start moving again.\n\nMy adjutant and soldiers looked at me in horror, as well as the young man with the same face as my deceased teacher. His soft hand held me and pulled me towards the village ahead that I had expressly forbidden to go to.\n\nI was too ashamed to go, and I didn't dare to go: I had mobilized the first group of people there, but I couldn't lead them to triumph; I had promised to make everyone poor, but I couldn't fulfill it; this was probably the fear and guilt shared by all of us generals. General Liao was like this back then, and so was I.\n\nBut the young man didn't seem to understand this. Perhaps it was because he was a military god who roamed the world and rarely suffered a defeat, or perhaps it was because he already knew the answer. In any case, he pulled me forward, and I was powerless to resist."

It also announced that it would relax the election criteria to allow several left-wing parties, including the Communist Party of Pakistan, to participate in the election.\nThe joint spokesperson of the Commission and the Senate said that this move was made "in consideration of the development of the domestic and international situation and the strong voice of the people." Observers pointed out that this sudden election will become an important turning point in Pakistan's political landscape."

  Chihong.20.desc: "The Pakistan Election Commission announced the final vote count this morning. The Popular Front Party Alliance, formed on the basis of the former Lahore Front, won more than half of the seats in the National Assembly with an absolute advantage of 47% of the votes, creating a major breakthrough in the country's political history.\nThe general secretary of the Popular Front said in his victory speech: "This is a victory for the Pakistani people. We will be committed to building a new Pakistan that is more fair, democratic and progressive." It is reported that the enthusiastic participation of a large number of young voters has become a notable feature of this election.\nThe election can be generally described as peaceful and orderly, and the new government is expected to be formally formed next week."

  Chihong.21.t: "Debate"
  Chihong.21.desc: "The Great Hall of the People was brightly lit. The old man on the rostrum had a solemn expression. He looked around at the hundreds of eyes below and slowly said: "Today we are going to discuss an important issue: whether to intervene in the revolutionary process in Afghanistan and Iran." The audience was boiling. Some shouted "export revolution" loudly, while others shook their heads in a low voice. The old man knocked on the table and signaled silence. "Please let the representatives of the supporters speak first." A middle-aged man wearing glasses stood up, his voice was steady and powerful: "Comrades, we once said that we wanted to be the torch of world revolution, but now we are hesitating whether to light this flame? Those Afghan farmers in rags, bending over in the fields, those Iranian workers who are suffocating under the oppression of theocracy, their eyes are looking at us!" His voice gradually became excited: "Have we forgotten how we got here? What would those revolutionary martyrs think? They shed blood and sacrificed their lives, not for us to sit here hesitating today! "\nThe applause was thunderous, but it was soon interrupted by the voice of another representative:\n"We all respect the revolutionary martyrs, but we must face reality," the white-haired old man slowly stood up, "The situation in West Asia is much more complicated than ours. Religious, tribal, and ethnic conflicts are intertwined, and external forces have serious infiltration. If we intervene rashly, can we guarantee that we will not repeat the mistakes of the Soviet Union?"\nThe old man's eyes swept across the audience.\n"I once led a team into the mountainous areas of Afghanistan. The villages there were dilapidated and the people were poor, but their vigilance against outsiders was engraved in their bones. The right to speak in the countryside is in the hands of the mullahs. Islam is rooted in the deepest part of the Afghan countryside. From a military perspective, what the Afghan people can embrace is still feudal warlord-style; from a cultural perspective, it is still religious brainwashing; from an economic perspective, it is still landlord class-style. The situation in Iran may be better. But it is definitely not much. "\n"Can we give an answer? Can we live up to their expectations? Can we...can we solve these problems?

  Chihong.22.t: "Faith"
  Chihong.22.desc: "Thirty miles north of Kabul, in the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains, on a barren land, old Karim sat in front of his mud house, looking at the blurred shadows of the mountains in the dusk. His fingers slowly stroked the well-read Quran, the edges of the parchment had been worn white by years of reading.\nMore than sixty years have carved deep grooves on his face. His cloudy eyes have witnessed the fall of the kingdom, the establishment of the "Republic", the fluttering of the red flag, the waving of the Stars and Stripes, and now they are back under the cover of the green flag.\n"Oh God..." he murmured to himself, his voice like a dead leaf in the autumn wind, "Why do you test us like this? "\nKarim put down the scripture and looked at the barren fields covered with gravel in the distance. When he was a teenager, he picked up a gun and followed his father and uncles to fight against the "red pagans"; when he was middle-aged, he took his eldest son to deal with the "American Crusaders" in the mountains. Both times, they cheered the victory, and both times, the mullahs declared that God's will was upheld.\nNow his eldest son is sleeping in the valley, and his youngest son is holding an old AK-47 and working at a checkpoint.\n"Uncle Karim, what are you thinking about?" Young Abdullah from the village came over, holding a skinny goat in his hand.\n"I wonder why this is happening." Karim's voice was hoarse, "The Soviets left, and our granaries didn't get fuller; the Americans left, and our wells are still dry."\nAbdullah put down the goat and sat next to the old man: "The mullah said that this is a punishment for our lack of faith."\nKarim smiled bitterly: "I heard this when I was young. My father heard this before he died." He pointed to the valley, "Look over there, twenty years ago, the white trucks of the United Nations came, bringing food and medicine. The mullah said it was the temptation of the infidels. Now there is no temptation." \n In the distance, several children were playing among the stones, their laughter was crisp but short, as if diluted by the barren air. \n "I used to think that as long as we drove away the foreigners, Allah would bless us." Karim picked up the crutches beside him and pointed to the sky, "We drove away two powerful countries, but look at our village, it is poorer than when I was a child." \n Abdullah lowered his head: "Maybe it will be different next time..." \n "Next time?" Karim shook his head, "I don't have a next time. I'm just an old farmer. I can't grow enough food, and I can't save my grandchildren." He slowly stroked his palm over the cracked land, "I have seen too much blood, but I have never seen a tulip bloom again. "\nHe didn't finish because the village mullah came over and announced that it was time for evening prayers.\nNot long ago, the pagan countries collapsed. The mullah told everyone that this was God's favor to believers and a reward for believers. In order to thank God for his power, he increased the frequency of evening prayers.\nThe mullah preached loudly in the mosque every week, saying that victory has belonged to true believers and that God will grant loyal servants a good harvest and wealth. People knelt, prayed, and waited for miracles to happen.\nKarim struggled He stood up and followed the villagers to the simple mosque. Tonight, the mullah will tell another story about faith and victory, just like every night in the past fifty years. \nBut Karim knew that when he woke up tomorrow, his fields would still be dry and his grandchildren would still be hungry. \nIn the prayer, the old man closed his eyes and called out again: he only hoped that the emirs in the capital would not change their policies every day and stop demolishing people. \nThe Quran on the table was illuminated by candlelight, but there was no ripple.

  Chihong.23.t: "Afghanistan Investigation Report"
  Chihong.23.desc: "I. Ethnicity and social structure The Hindu Kush Mountains are like a natural barrier, dividing Afghanistan into countless unconnected valleys and plateaus. In these isolated spaces, ethnic groups have passed down their own languages, customs and hatreds from generation to generation.\nPashtuns account for about 45% of the total population, mainly distributed in the south and east, and are the main support base of the Taliban. However, even among the Pashtuns, the conflicts between tribes are intricate. The Tajiks in the north (27%), the Hazaras in the center (9%) and the Uzbeks in the northwest (9%) have long been excluded and oppressed.\nOur investigators recorded the words of an old Hazara man in Bamiyan Province: "Whenever the black flag of the Taliban appears at the mountain pass, we know that another disaster is coming. We are not a country, we are just prisoners who are forcibly tied together. ”\n2. Economic Foundation\nAfghanistan’s economic structure has been completely distorted. More than 40 years of war have destroyed the traditional agricultural system, irrigation facilities have fallen into disrepair, and a large amount of arable land has been abandoned. In the provinces south of Kabul, we see vast tracts of land planted with poppies, which is an important source of income for the Taliban.\nA farmer in Kandahar told us: “If you grow wheat, the whole family will starve to death; if you grow poppies, at least the children can have enough food. "It is estimated that the opium trade accounts for more than 30% of Afghanistan's GDP, and the Taliban obtains a lot of money by collecting "taxes" or even selling it themselves.\nAt the same time, the unemployment rate in cities is as high as 35%, and a large number of young people have nothing to do, becoming the target of recruitment by extremist organizations.\n3. Political and religious situation\nThe Taliban regime's ruling foundation is built on three pillars: religious authority, tribal relations and armed forces. They use religion to legitimize their rule and define all opposition voices as "heresies", but at the same time, conservatives and reformists within their regime are constantly arguing and changing their orders.\nHowever, we observe that among the younger generation, doubts about the extreme interpretation of the Taliban are increasing. Near Kabul University, the students we secretly contacted told us: "We are not against Islam, we are against oppression implemented in the name of Islam. "\nIn the north and central regions, resistance to the Taliban has never stopped. We have recorded at least 17 underground resistance organizations in operation, many of which are remnants of the Maoists of the last century.\nIV. Evaluation of revolutionary conditions\n1. Favorable factors:\n(1) Sharp ethnic conflicts and general resistance to the Taliban by non-Pashtun ethnic groups;\n(2) There is a strong desire for change among young people;\n(3) The economic crisis is intensifying and people are living in hardship;\n(4) There are still organized resistance forces.\n2. Disadvantages: \n(1) Religious forces are deeply rooted; \n(2) Tribal loyalty is higher than national identity; \n(3) The people are generally wary of foreign forces (historical lessons from the Soviet Union and the United States); \n(4) The terrain is complex, transportation is inconvenient, and it is difficult to form a united front. \nV. Strategic Recommendations\nThe Taliban regime is essentially a reactionary regime that relies on clan power, religious power structure and violence to maintain its existence, rather than "the choice of the people." As Comrade Lenin said, we should clearly distinguish the boundaries between "anti-imperialism" and "progress" - not all forces opposing imperialism are worthy of support, especially when such opposition comes from more reactionary classes. \nIf we decide to take action, we suggest: \n1. First establish bases in Hazara and Tajik areas; \n2. Support progressive secular forces and avoid getting involved in religious disputes \n3. Emphasize land reform and economic development, rather than ideology; \n4. Establish a multi-ethnic united front to avoid being seen as a foreign invader"

  Chihong.24.desc: "A 22-year-old Iranian Kurdish woman named Mahesa Amini was arrested by the morality police in Tehran because she was said to be wearing a headscarf too loosely. Later, the police said that Amini collapsed in the police station due to sudden heart failure and died after two days of coma. But witnesses said that she was beaten before her death and her head hit the side of the police car. Her brain scans showed that she had fractures, bleeding and cerebral edema in her head.\n\nAmini's death triggered a series of large-scale protests across the country. In order to suppress the tide of demonstrators, the Iranian government used tear gas and high-pressure water cannons to disperse demonstrators, and even used birdshot and metal bullets to shoot and kill. It also blocked a large number of applications including Instagram and WhatsApp, and restricted Internet connections to weaken the protesters' ability to organize. This is the largest Internet restriction since Iran completely shut down the Internet in 2019."

The picture was a blurry photo of several masked men holding weapons, and the eye-catching red font under the title read: "These atheists controlled by evil forces are trying to undermine the stability of the Islamic Republic. The police say everything is under control." Navid snorted contemptuously and turned off the push. It has been three months since he graduated from the Department of Political Science at the University of Tehran. He has been reading these propaganda-like news for twenty-three years and has long been numb. "Have you really decided? Travel around the country?" asked his roommate Amir, leaning against the door frame. "Yes, I want to see the real face of this country before looking for a job." Navid closed the suitcase, "I've been in the bubble of Tehran for too long." \n\nAmir lowered his voice: "Be careful, the situation is not stable now. Ever since that girl..."\n\nNavid nodded.

Just the night before, the cheap hotel he was staying in was broken into, and his laptop and some cash were looted.

When Navid stood up and wanted to change seats, the man whispered: "Don't be so nervous, pretty boy. In this country, we all need some small comfort, don't we?"\n\nNavid felt a wave of nausea.

He witnessed the moment when sticks fell on young faces and saw blood flowing from the forehead of a young man who was no more than 20 years old. When he tried to step forward to help a girl who was pushed down, a Basij member pushed him away fiercely.\n\n"Get out!

Outside the window, the outline of the Zagros Mountains loomed in the moonlight.\nHe recalled the journey of the past few months: the looted property, the violence he witnessed, the shame of being violated, and the ubiquitous fear and repression. He remembered the professors in the classrooms of Tehran University carefully avoiding sensitive topics; he remembered the fire in the eyes of the young people who bravely stood up during the Mahsa struggle; he remembered the complicated expressions of the old people when they talked about the "people in the mountains" along the way.\nThe official media called them terrorists, pagans and unbelievers, and running dogs of the West. But Navid He began to wonder if those who fled to the mountains were just like him, tired of lies and oppression? \nAt dawn, Navid made a decision. He packed his simple bag, left his room fee, and walked out of the inn. \nNo one guided him, no one recruited him, only the irrepressible desire deep in his heart drove him. He was not sure if he could find those "people in the mountains", or even what would happen after he found them. But he knew that he could never go back to the world that pretended everything was normal. \nNavid looked back at the town for the last time, then turned around and walked into the depths of the mountain.

This marks that this Middle Eastern country has officially fallen into a state of civil war.\n\nAccording to reports, the armed forces formed by the Communist Party of Iran, the People's Party of Iran and other left-wing coalitions mobilized the masses to launch a large-scale armed uprising in provinces such as Kurdistan, Lorestan and Isfahan, claiming to recapture the fruits of the 1979 revolution.\n\nAt the same time, the Chinese government issued a statement publicly recognizing and supporting the new regime, saying that it "represents the just cause of the Iranian people in pursuit of freedom and progress." After the conflict broke out, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and government forces quickly counterattacked. Tehran's Supreme Leader Khamenei delivered a televised speech, accusing the rebels of being "traitors controlled by infidels" and vowing to "defend the dignity of the Islamic Republic with flesh and blood."\n\nAccording to reporters on the scene, the two sides engaged in fierce exchanges of fire at several strategic locations.

The explosion built an invisible fence in front of the rolling black tide, giving him a chance to catch his breath. As he retreated into the next trench, a question suddenly popped up in Jeremy's mind: How did he get to this hellhole?\nA few months ago, Jeremy Olu almost laughed out loud when he received the order to go to Miami for peacekeeping: the blue helmets that used to be active in various third worlds were actually going to the United States to perform missions. This was a huge benefit. However, after arriving in Miami, he realized how naive he was: the scene in front of him was far from the sunny beaches and luxury hotels he imagined. Most of Miami has become a charred battlefield, the once prosperous seaside avenue is full of craters, and the glass curtain walls of skyscrapers reflect the blazing flames.\n"Olu! The third team is short of people, go to reinforce the eastern defense line! "The lieutenant's shout brought Jeremy back to reality. He climbed out of the trench, crouched and ran to the designated location. Along the way, he could see the busy scene in the temporary medical station - UN medical staff were urgently treating a group of civilian casualties, mostly women and children injured in the latest cleansing operation of the "Nuclear Division".\nJeremy arrived at the eastern defense line and quickly checked the ammunition reserves and trench conditions. It was not optimistic - there was not much ammunition left, and the last batch of supplies arrived a few days ago. The supplies that should have arrived yesterday were nowhere to be found. They could only learn to calculate every bullet carefully.\n"Here they come again," whispered Kassem, a veteran from Senegal beside him, "There are many more people this time."\nJeremy raised the telescope. "Yes, it seems that they are determined to take our position this time. "He checked the scope on his rifle and touched the last two grenades in his breast pocket.\nAs night fell, disturbing news came from the radio: the nuclear division had captured the northern checkpoint, and the UN station was left with only one line of defense. Their reinforcements were blocked fifty kilometers away and would take at least two days to arrive. Jeremy knew what this meant - the wing had become an isolated force and could not expect any support in the future.\nThat night, Jeremy wrote to his wife who was already abroad under the starlight: "Dear Ade, the United States is not what we imagined. Here, I see the coexistence of the most noble ideals of mankind and the most cruel evil. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I know that what we are doing is right. If I don't make it home, please tell our son that his father died protecting those who couldn't protect themselves..."\nHe didn't finish. The sirens pierced the night sky, and Jeremy put down the letter and checked his gun neatly to make sure the magazine was full. He put on his helmet, tightened his tactical vest for the last time, and rushed to the front line. Ten years of combat experience made every move he made fast and precise.\nIn the distance, the convoy of the Nuclear Weapons Division approached with searchlights on, and the black sun and swastika flag fluttered in the night wind, like demons rushing out of hell. Jeremy lay down behind the bunker, adjusted his breathing, and lightly pulled the trigger with his fingers. Every bullet found the target, but these efforts seemed so insignificant in front of the heavy weapons of the Nuclear Weapons Division.\nIn the distance, a dazzling light flashed on the horizon, followed by a deafening roar. Jeremy's heart sank-it was the characteristic flash of the 155mm howitzer.\n"Get down! "He screamed, but it was too late to warn.\nThe first round of artillery fire landed accurately on the front line, the whole ground was shaking, and sandbags and concrete fragments were flying everywhere."

He knew that the local garrison's arsenal had been looted, and that a whole unit of American troops had defected with their full equipment. The existence of these heavy artillery pieces was not surprising in itself, but what was really surprising was that they had not taken them out a few days ago.\n"Qasim!" Jeremy searched for his comrades in the ruins, but only saw an arm sticking out of the rubble, with the UN armband on it soaked in blood.\nThe intermittent voice of the lieutenant came from the radio: "Attention everyone... The enemy has deployed M777 howitzers and HIMARS multiple rocket systems... They are bombarding all known positions...

When he arrived at the medical station, he saw a chaos - medical staff were urgently transferring the wounded, but everyone's face was full of despair.\n"Headquarters has lost contact," the chief doctor told him with a trembling voice, "our evacuation route has been cut off." "How many more wounded are there?" Jeremy asked.\n"Thirty-seven people, most of whom cannot move on their own."\nJeremy gritted his teeth: "I have a plan."\nHe quickly organized the remaining soldiers to build a hidden passage and began to transfer the wounded.

Then came the second, the third... like a deadly rain, falling continuously.\n"Guided bombs!" Jeremy realized that the situation was worse than he had imagined, "They are using precision-guided artillery shells!"\nThey were trapped in the medical station, surrounded by an approaching artillery circle. Each explosion made the building shake more violently, and the cracks in the walls continued to widen.\n"We must evacuate in a dispersed manner," Jeremy said to the remaining dozen soldiers,\n"Each person takes two wounded and breaks out along different routes." When the last group of people were about to leave, Jeremy noticed that there were three seriously injured people in the corner with no one to take care of them.\n"You go first," he said to the last soldier, "I'll take care of them. "\n"But sir..."\n"This is an order!" Jeremy said firmly, "I'll find a way."\nWhen everyone left, Jeremy stared at the three wounded, struggling internally. He knew he couldn't take everyone away at the same time, and leaving anyone behind meant death.\nOutside, the engine sounds of the heavy armored vehicles of the Nuclear Weapons Division were getting closer and closer, accompanied by the precise bursts of howitzers, which gradually eroded the area controlled by the blue helmets.\nJeremy made a decision. He helped the three wounded hide in the basement, used up all the medical supplies to bandage them, and made sure they had enough water and food. "Someone will come to save you," he said, "Hold on.

He knew he couldn't stop the massacre, but maybe he could buy some time for others. In the scope, he locked the artillery commander.\nThe moment he pulled the trigger, the commander in the distance fell down. The artillery fire of the Nuclear Weapon Division immediately turned to his position.\nJeremy quickly moved and continued to snipe key targets. He successfully killed two gunners and a communications officer, but his ammunition was about to run out. After the last bullet ran out, he took out the unfinished letter and hurriedly wrote the last words on the back:\n"Dear Ade, when you receive this letter, I will be gone. Please tell our son that his father did not back down in the face of evil. Although we failed, one day, justice will triumph over cruelty. I love you, forever..."\nHe didn't finish.

  Chihong.36.t: "Report on Japan's potential military adventure"
  Chihong.36.desc: "\n\n\n £GFX_MSS_event_texticon \n\n\n\n\n Dear Comrade Chairman:\nSince the end of the Taiwan Strait Campaign, Japan has sought to amend its constitution to promote the so-called "normalization of the country". Specifically, Article 9 of Japan's peace constitution on the renunciation of the right to war has been amended, and its armed forces have been renamed the Imperial Japanese Army. These measures have shown that Japan's efforts to de-militarize since World War II have completely failed. The Japanese government's series of measures are not only a serious threat to regional peace, but also a complete subversion of the post-war international order.\nIn terms of domestic affairs, the Japanese government has taken a series of tough measures to consolidate its militarist policies. First, in the name of "national security", through the "Special Security Maintenance Law" and other evil laws, cruelly suppress anti-war groups, establish a system of ideological censorship, and comprehensively suppress pacifist voices; second, reconstruct the national education system, comprehensively implement military training courses in the basic education stage, and systematically implement militarism by tampering with history textbooks and manipulating media public opinion. Ideological indoctrination. \n In terms of diplomacy, Japan has adopted a more aggressive strategy. In Northeast Asia, it has used the Korean Peninsula as a strategic breakthrough point, frequently creating incidents such as the "Takeshima Crisis" and the "Fishing Boat Incident" in an attempt to reconstruct the regional security architecture; in terms of military construction, it has secretly promoted the separation of weapons-grade plutonium in Aomori, Fukui and other places under the cover of "civilian nuclear energy", and its nuclear armament process has posed a real threat to the global non-proliferation system. \n Faced with such a severe situation, we must immediately take decisive measures to comprehensively enhance the state of national defense combat readiness and be prepared to meet any unexpected events. At the same time, it is necessary to intensify international diplomatic offensives, expose Japan's aggressive intentions, and win broad support and cooperation from the international community to curb its dangerous military adventures. \n Comrade Chairman, we are on the brink of war, and any negligence may lead to serious consequences. We will continue to closely monitor developments and report the latest intelligence to you in a timely manner. \n Sincerely, \n Salute. "

He emphasized that against the backdrop of the United States falling into civil war and the deepening crisis of the Western capitalist system, our country has successfully achieved the complete reunification of the motherland and socialist construction has entered a new stage. The holding of the Proletarian Cultural Festival is precisely to further strengthen class consciousness throughout society, consolidate the dominant position of the proletariat, and resist the erosion of the decadent bourgeois culture.\nThis cultural festival lasts for one week and the activities are rich and colorful. At the opening ceremony, representatives from Taiwan Province performed a large-scale music and dance epic "The Road to Reunification", and the moving scene attracted the whole nation. warm applause. Afterwards, the workers' art group performed the drama "Fighting in the Workshop" which reflects the spirit of grassroots struggle; the peasant delegation brought the newly created folk song "Harvest Fields"; and the PLA Art Troupe performed the song and dance "Heroic Hymn" to commemorate the Taiwan Strait Unification Campaign. \nDuring the cultural festival, industrial achievement exhibitions, agricultural harvest exhibitions and revolutionary traditional education exhibitions will be held simultaneously across the country. It is particularly worth mentioning that this cultural festival has set up an "International Revolutionary Art Exchange Zone", inviting artists from socialist countries around the world to participate in exchanges and showcase the achievements of proletarian cultural development in various countries. \nIt is understood that major online platforms have opened special live broadcast channels for the cultural festival, and units across the country have organized collective viewing. After watching, Master Wang of Baosteel said excitedly: "I feel extremely proud to see that the cultural status of our working class has been so improved! Such a cultural festival is a festival that truly belongs to our working people! "\nThe head of the Central Propaganda Department said that holding the National Proletarian Cultural Festival is an important measure to implement the "Left-wing Cultural Renaissance Project" in the new era. In the future, provinces and cities will take turns to host local proletarian cultural festivals to form a new pattern of national cultural development. The Ministry of Culture also announced a series of supporting policies, including increasing support for literary and artistic creation on worker and peasant themes, establishing a worker writer training program, promoting various units to accelerate the establishment and improvement of employee cultural clubs, and carrying out theme activities such as "Searching for Working Class Heroes" across the country.\nIt is reported that the closing ceremony of the cultural festival will be held on May 10, when the "Chinese Proletarian Cultural Manifesto" will be issued, making systematic arrangements for promoting socialist cultural construction under the new situation and contributing more wisdom and strength to the construction of socialist new culture."

As a college student, he has become accustomed to this daily routine of climbing over the firewall.\nJust when he was about to give up, his roommate Wang Hao suddenly shouted excitedly: "Brother Ming, do you know? I heard that the firewall control has been lifted!"\nLi Ming sneered: "Don't be funny, this rumor is spread several times a year."\n"It's not a rumor!" Wang Hao handed him the phone, "Official announcement, because of the reorganization of the international network after the American Civil War, China's Internet will fully open international connections."\nLi Ming took the phone half-believingly and read the news from Xinhua News Agency carefully. Then, with a try-it mentality, he directly entered the Twitter URL in the browser address bar.\nUnexpectedly, the page really started to load. There was no familiar timeout prompt, no connection reset error. But after waiting for nearly a minute, the page only loaded a simple error prompt: "Due to server damage, Twitter is temporarily unable to provide full service. ”\nHe tried Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram again, but the results were similar - either the error page loaded extremely slowly, or it simply could not connect.\n"What's going on?" Li Ming scratched his head.\nWang Hao shrugged: "Many data centers in Silicon Valley were directly destroyed, and foreign Internet infrastructure was severely damaged. Everyone knows what the United States is like now."\nLi Ming suddenly realized: "So the firewall was lifted not because of a policy shift, but because..."\n"Because there is nothing to block anymore." Wang Hao took over the conversation, "Those foreign platforms themselves are not working."\nLi Ming was silent for a while, and suddenly laughed: "Hehe, the wall we tried so hard to climb over has collapsed, but we found that the world outside has changed."\nHe closed the inaccessible websites and opened Bilibili. On the screen, countless messages and comments from foreign users came into view. They were heatedly discussing how to adapt to China's social platforms and network environment.\n"It seems that now they are coming in. "Li Ming sighed.

  Chihong.40.desc: "Xinhua News Agency, Beijing: As the American civil war continues to deepen, major global network servers built on the US mainland have suffered serious damage, and many internationally renowned social media platforms have been paralyzed. Against this backdrop, Chinese social platforms are experiencing an unprecedented surge in international users and have become a new center for global network communication.\nAccording to the latest data from the State Cyberspace Administration of China, in the past three months, the number of newly registered users of the international version of Xiaohongshu has exceeded 200 million, among which the number of users from Europe and South America has increased most significantly. WeChat's overseas version has added more than 300 million new users during the same period, and the supported language versions have expanded from the original 20 to 37.\n"I never thought of using Chinese social platforms before, but now they are my only choice." Carlos, a reporter from Brazil, told our reporter through the international version of Weibo, "To my surprise, these platforms have much richer functions than I thought. ”\nFaced with the sudden surge in users, major Chinese social platforms quickly adjusted their strategies. WeChat, Douyin and Xiaohongshu announced that they would increase investment in overseas servers and urgently expand their multilingual content review teams to cope with the surge in international user demand. At the same time, in order to solve the barriers to cross-cultural communication, major platforms have launched AI tools that support real-time translation in 94 languages ​​to facilitate cross-border communication.\nIndustry experts pointed out that this sudden change in the global network landscape has brought unprecedented international opportunities to Chinese Internet companies, but they are also facing many challenges. Experts said: "We need to adapt to the usage habits and expression needs of international users more flexibly while maintaining the network management model with Chinese characteristics."\nThe State Council Information Office recently issued an announcement stating that it will moderately adjust the user content management policy and provide a more open communication environment for international users on the premise of complying with Chinese laws and regulations.\nThe industry generally believes that this change may reshape the global Internet ecology, and Chinese social platforms are expected to upgrade from "Chinese services" to "global services" in this process, further enhancing China's voice in the global digital economy and network governance.

Senior officers of the Taiwan puppet army and those die-hard "Taiwan independence" government civil servants were on the same bus. The bus was dull.\n\nThe woman who had once called the wind and rain on the island of Taiwan now looked ashen, not wanting to say a word. She just looked through the one-way glass at the bustling streets of Taipei as usual, as if she had never been there and the war had never broken out - if it weren't for the small bullet holes on the wall still staring at her teasingly.\n\nLai Qingde kept banging his head against the seat in front of him, his teeth chattering. He stood up and wanted to shout a few words, but when he saw that everyone on the bus was lying like dead pigs, he sat down dejectedly, staring at an unknown direction with a dark face."

After the guards finished their last round of inspection, he suddenly got up, fumbled in the dark for a long time, and grabbed a piece of glass from under his pillow.\n\nHe took a deep breath, opened his mouth, and prepared to swallow the glass directly into his stomach, but when his tongue felt the cold texture of the glass fragment, he changed the direction of the glass fragment several times, trying to find a more suitable angle to swallow the glass, but it seemed that this angle could not be found. Then, he mustered up his courage, picked up the sharpest end of the glass fragment and pointed it at his abdomen, doing He made a gesture as if he was going to perform a caesarean section. But he just stretched out his hand, gesturing for a long time, as if he couldn't find where his abdomen was. He gritted his teeth, rolled up his sleeves again, exposing his wrists, and prepared to let the black blood in his veins gush out. Before cutting, he recalled many things. He thought that he would be dismembered by the devil and his soul would be burned by the flames of hell. He thought of many terrible things, so he finally made up his mind and cut it hard -\n\nThen, a little blood seeped out of his wound, and then gathered into a blood spot and stopped flowing out. Then he threw the glass fragments away and kicked them aside. "

But the bailiffs behind him stepped over him directly. Tsai Ing-wen was taken to the original venue of the pseudo-legislative council, a place she was very familiar with. Lai Qingde was escorted to the detention center and strictly guarded. He deserves to be tried in private so that others can come and see his circus. \n\nNow, the Legislative Council has been set up as a perfect courtroom. Except for the statue of Sun Yat-sen, all other symbols have been cleaned up and replaced with the national emblem of the People's Republic of China. The entire courtroom is full of people, and a large group of reporters holding cameras are broadcasting this moment to the world. \n\nShe wanted to deliberately fall down or pretend to limp in, but the court bailiff helped her to the bench, which made her trick meaningless.

The gavel fell, and the entire courtroom quickly became quiet. Only Tsai Ing-wen was so scared that she almost couldn't stand.\n\nThen, after the judge read out the court rules, the prosecutor stood up and began to read the indictment word by word. But the woman just quietly clasped her hands on the wooden railing of the defendant's seat, gritted her teeth, and only heard this sentence clearly:\n\n"Tsai Ing-wen and her accomplices have long accepted foreign help, ignored the laws of the People's Republic of China, actively cooperated with foreign forces to promote Taiwan independence, organized illegal armed forces, and even actively accepted foreign armed forces to seek independence by force, disregarding the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty and the safety of people's lives and property, and have constituted the crime of splitting the country and treason. The above charges are clear in facts and sufficient in evidence. According to the Anti-Secession Law, the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China, and the Criminal Procedure Law of the People's Republic of China, they should be sentenced to life imprisonment.

Various materials and notes were piled up on the peeling wall. "Professor Chen, the Central Committee has just issued a document on strengthening the construction of Marxist disciplines," the secretary handed a red-headed document to his desk, "Do you think we should reopen the research room? ”\nNow his lecture notes are printed on coated paper, with the words "Research Center for the Sinification of Marxism" embossed on the gold-plated school emblem. Last week, when I went to Beijing for a meeting, the newspaper of the day was placed on the seat of the high-speed rail, and there was an interview with him in the lower right corner of the front page. In the photo, Professor Chen was in high spirits and complacent, and the caption read: Senior scholars of Wuhan University talk about theoretical innovation in the new era.\nWhat impressed him most was the change in the attitude of teachers and students. In the past, he always sat in the west corner to eat alone, but now as soon as he sat down, someone came over with a tray: "Mr. Chen, the historical materialism methodology you talked about last time..." Even Professor Zhou from the School of Economics, who always laughed at him as an "old antique", came to borrow his edited "Chronology of Marx and Engels" last week.\nAfter get off work in the afternoon, he went to the ideological and political area on the third floor of the library as usual. The sunset passed through the colored glass, and the bookshelves were also reflected with golden light. When the administrator girl saw Professor Chen coming again, she whispered: "Teacher Chen, the newly arrived Russian original version of "The Complete Works of Lenin" is kept for you. "When he thanked me, he saw out the window that several students were posting notices for the "Shou Ming Academic Thought Seminar" on the poster board. The reflection of the wet ink was like the surface of a lake in spring.\nSuddenly, he remembered that snowy day in 1997, when he took three months of pension and took a green train to Beijing to buy used books. In front of the stall in Panjiayuan, the old man selling books held the original German version of "Anti-Dühring" and asked: "Do you really want to buy it? It's enough to buy cabbage for half a year." He put his frozen red hands into his sleeves, exhaled white air and said: "

Sarah, who was over 60 years old, stood by the Chao Phraya River, looking at the flag that symbolized victory, with tears in his eyes.\nMore than 40 years of guerrilla experience seemed like yesterday. He still remembered when he was 20 years old, when he had just joined the revolutionary team and was full of ideals to change the world. He remembered the trembling of holding the gun for the first time, the first rainy season in the jungle, the laughter and singing of his comrades, the voices of the older comrades teaching simple revolutionary theories, and the clanging sounds of the masses in the base area when they were plowing the land.\nLater, there was a long period of darkness. He still remembered the despair of the 1990s, when the news of the disintegration of the Soviet Union came, and many old comrades laid down their weapons. "Maybe we were wrong," they said, "maybe this road is not feasible. "One after another, the comrades left the jungle, some returned to the city, and some died silently. Whether it was singing, laughter or the calls of the masses, everything seemed to have returned to silence. At that time, he often sat alone by the campfire, looking at the dancing flames, accompanied by the faint chirping of insects in the forest, thinking of those faces that he would never see again. But he and a few comrades still insisted on fighting in the jungle, even if there were only a few dozen people left, even if the outside world believed that the Thai Communist Party had died.\nNow, when he looked at the red flag, how could he not shed tears? This revolutionary road was so difficult. How many comrades fell, how many ideals were ridiculed, and how many times they were declared dead.\nOn this spring morning, he finally saw the dawn."
  china.1710.a: "A long-cherished wish has come true"
  china.1711.t: "Dawn"
  china.1711.d: "The cold is biting on the Yalu River. Lieutenant Li Zhenghao wrapped his military coat tightly and looked at the thin ice floating on the river. Last night, his superiors suddenly ordered to reduce the frequency of patrols, saying it was to "save manpower." This order came strangely, but he didn't dare to ask more. In the darkness, the sound of the river flowing was intermittent. He raised the night vision goggles, and there was silence on the other side of the river. At three o'clock in the morning at this time of year, even hares are hibernating. "Report to Comrade Lieutenant, there is no abnormality in the western section." The voice of the subordinate came from the communicator. "Got it. "He answered mechanically.\nI don't know since when, this sense of mechanicalness has permeated his life. Every morning at six o'clock, they line up, shouting slogans that no one believes in, and saluting the capital in the south. They are all acting, acting a play that everyone knows is a play, but no one dares to point it out.\nThe sky in the east is pale.\nHe suddenly noticed that there were strange ripples on the river. It was not a natural water flow, but... His pupils suddenly contracted.\nIn the darkness, countless rubber boats were silently crossing the river. In the night vision goggles, he saw a familiar figure. It was squad leader Zhang, who exchanged cigarettes with him at the border last week. PLA soldiers. \nAt this moment, squad leader Zhang was standing on the rubber boat in the front, with a neat battle formation behind him. \nLi Zhenghao put down the night vision goggles and showed a bitter smile. He finally understood. He understood why the border officers were so uneasy recently, and why there was that inexplicable order to reduce patrols. \n"Report, found in the east section..." A hurried voice came from the communicator. \nHe turned off the communicator. \nThe sky in the east began to turn red, like a splash-ink landscape painting that was ignited from the bottom. The morning glow dyed the river red and was also reflected on the helmets of the soldiers on the opposite bank. \n"Surrender!" He suddenly shouted at the river, and his voice echoed in the morning mist. \nThe rubber boat continued to approach silently. He threw away the rifle and raised his hands. At this moment, he felt that the burden on his body was finally lifted. For many years, they have lived in hunger and fear, numb in lies and deception. \n"We have been waiting for this day for a long time. "He said softly.\nThe first ray of sunlight penetrated the clouds and shone on his face. In the distant military camp, sporadic gunshots had been heard. But he knew that it would not last long. Because there were more people who had awakened like him than anyone could imagine.\nA rubber boat came ashore. Squad Leader Zhang jumped ashore and walked towards him.\n"It's better to come in time than to come early." Squad Leader Zhang said with a smile, handing him a cigarette, "Catch up with dawn."\nLi Zhenghao took the cigarette and took a deep breath. Yes, dawn. He looked at the eastern sky, where the red glow became brighter and brighter. "
  china.1711.a: "A new day has finally arrived."
  china.1712.t: "Broken Myths"
  china.1712.d: "To the General Staff: \nWe now report the summary of the "Shoot the Sun" operation and the analysis of the current situation. \nI. Summary of the "Shoot the Sun" military operation \nThe 82nd Army Group was the advance force, and the 78th Army Group and the 83rd Army Group were the left and right wings that crossed the Yalu River in the early morning. Under the full-scale detection of the Space Force, our electronic warfare forces accurately paralyzed the North Korean air defense system and communication network, causing its various troops to fall into a state of command chaos, almost paralyzing the North Korean command system. The border defense forces of the Korean People's Army surrendered without almost any resistance, and then the 425th Armored Division and the 806th Mechanized Division of North Korea successively laid down their weapons, which created favorable conditions for our army to advance rapidly \nIt is worth noting that the "Long March" system discovered the abnormal mobilization of the North Korean nuclear arsenal in a timely manner by analyzing satellite images and electromagnetic signals. Under the guidance of satellites, our special forces successfully raided and controlled the Yongbyon nuclear facilities, preventing possible extreme actions by the enemy. \nHowever, the Pyongyang Capital Garrison and the 105th Armored Division and the 8th Special Operations Corps put up a stubborn resistance. Our 81st Army suffered nearly 100 casualties when breaking through the Nampo defense line. Fortunately, the 83rd Army, under the cover of the Air Force and armed helicopter formations, made a detour from Wonsan, cutting off the main traffic arteries in the east of Pyongyang, forcing the defenders to give up further resistance. \nIt is particularly worth mentioning that the deputy commander of the 91st Capital Defense Corps of the Korean People’s Army took the lead in instigating an uprising and opened the passage to the underground command post of the Kim Dynasty. This provided key intelligence for our special forces to successfully capture Kim Jong-un\nDuring the entire operation, the coordinated operations of the Space Force, the Electronic Countermeasures Force and the "Long March" AI system demonstrated the comprehensive combat capabilities of our army in modern warfare and minimized our casualties. \nII. Results and Statistics of casualties\n-\tA total of 63,240 enemies were killed\n-\t378,910 prisoners\n-\tNearly 600,000 people surrendered and revolted\n-\t486 tanks and 417 armored vehicles were seized...\n-\t2,640 of our people were killed and 8,910 were injured\n3. Assessment of the current situation\nNot surprisingly, the attitude of the North Korean people towards the People's Liberation Army is relatively complicated. The situation in the border areas is better, but in the urban area of ​​Pyongyang, only about 20% of the people showed a welcoming attitude. What is more worrying is that in Sinuiju, Chongjin and other places, there have been many incidents of people storming detention centers where important members of the Kim regime are held. \nConsistent with pre-war analysis, this phenomenon is related to the long-term ideological control of the people by the Kim regime. Many people still regard the Kim family as "gods." When the "gods" collapsed, a sense of loss arose instead. . \nFourth, recommended measures\n1.\tPostpone the public trial of Kim Jong-un, and suggest that he be detained in secret first. \n2.\tIncrease the propaganda and education efforts for the North Korean people, focusing on exposing the crimes of the Kim regime, but the wording should be cautious to avoid stimulating national sentiment. \n3.\tPrioritize the restoration of people's livelihood supplies, especially food and electricity. The logistics department has been requested to speed up transportation. \n4.\tProper placement of officers of the Korean People's Army who surrendered may be given, and some of them may be considered for appointment in the new regime. \nFive, follow-up prospects\nIt takes time to break the deep-rooted personality cult. It is recommended that the headquarters adopt a gradual strategy in promoting subsequent reforms and avoid rushing. The top priority is to stabilize the people's hearts and let the North Korean people truly feel the meaning of liberation. \nI hereby report, please approve. \nThe commander-in-chief of this operation and commander of the 82nd Army Group\tLin Xiangyang"
  china.1712.a: "Before the public trial, Kim Jong-un's safety must be protected to avoid any accidents."
  china.1713.t: "Grievances Conference"
  china.1713.d: "In the suburbs of Chongjin, North Hamgyong Province, in an agricultural cooperative auditorium.\nOld man Park Hun-sik sat in a corner with a gloomy look in his eyes. In the past week, the People's Liberation Army has distributed warm steamed buns to the community every day and helped them with agricultural production every day. There has never been a shortage of water in the water tank. He had to admit that these were the days when he had the most food in many years, and they really didn't seem to be bad. But today, he was still dragged to this "grievance meeting" by his son.\nIn the front row of the auditorium, several arrested local officials lowered their heads, handcuffed on their wrists. The projection screen has been set up.\n"Comrades," the PLA instructor who presided over the meeting was named Wang, speaking not very standard Korean, "Today, we have to speak our minds and settle accounts. "\nPark Hun-sik suddenly stood up: "I want to talk about how American imperialism blocked us! If it weren't for..."\n"Old man," Instructor Wang interrupted him gently, "Do you still remember the days around 1995? "\nThe auditorium was silent. That was the nightmare of the "March of Hardship" that no one wanted to recall.\n"Let's watch a video first." The projector lit up. In the picture, a former Party Secretary of South Pyongan Province was explaining the problem. He described how local bureaucrats withheld relief supplies and used the aided fertilizers as a stepping stone to exchange for promotion channels, while ordinary farmers could only regress to small peasant economy.\n"After the collapse of the CMEA, North Korea lost an important source of oil." Instructor Wang explained, "But even in that case, so many people could have avoided starving to death. However, these people..."\nHe pointed to the officials in the front row, "What are they doing? Let's continue watching."\nA new picture appeared. It was a surveillance video of a senior official's home. While the people were starving, they were toasting in a mansion. The wife of an official complained that foreign cosmetics were out of stock and a special plane had to be sent to buy them.\n"I...I want to say." A thin woman stood up, "At that time, my husband worked in a steel plant. The factory trucks ran out of fuel and could only burn firewood. In the end, there was no firewood left and they had to rely on people to do it bit by bit. But the rations distributed to the workers..."\nShe couldn't continue. Suppressed sobs sounded in the auditorium.\n"Look at this." Instructor Wang switched to a new screen. It was a list of the property of a senior official: luxury houses, famous watches, foreign currency deposits... In the area under his jurisdiction, the farmers were just holding porridge.\nPark Xunzhi's hands began to tremble. He thought of those years, his brother who starved to death, and his granddaughter who died because of lack of medicine. And these people, these officials who were supposed to serve the people...\n"Kill them!" Someone shouted.\n"Shoot the corrupt officials!" Shouts came one after another.\nInstructor Wang raised his hand: "Fellow villagers, I understand your anger. These people will be punished by law. But more importantly, we have to think about why this happened? Who gave them so much power to do whatever they want? ”\nThe auditorium fell silent. People were thinking.\n“When a regime’s rulers only care about their own power and don’t care about the lives of the people. When carrying out radical economic reforms means shaking their power, they would rather let the people starve. Such a regime...”\nHe didn’t finish, but everyone understood.\n“Comrades,” Instructor Wang said, “It’s not that we don’t have the ability to live a good life. It’s that some people would rather let the entire country stagnate in order to maintain their own privileges. They are afraid that reforms will shake their rule, so they would rather let the people continue to suffer..."\nIn the auditorium, there were cries, sighs, and voices intertwined.\nThe next morning, in the crowded square, several gunshots broke the tranquility of Chongjin, followed by cheers that resounded through the sky. Those corrupt officials paid the price for their crimes.\nBut for the North Korean people, this is just the beginning. They finally realized that the real enemy is not just external forces, but the key is this distorted system itself.\nAt this moment, similar scenes are being played out in factories, rural areas, and military camps across North Korea. Lies are exposed one by one, and the truth is revealed to the world. In tears, regret, and anger, people finally see this absurd privilege system.\nAs the sun sets, the afterglow shines in through the windows of the auditorium. Park Hun-sik looked at the light and suddenly realized that he, like tens of millions of compatriots on this land, had been deceived for too long.\nAnd now, it's time to open your eyes."
  china.1713.a: "Finally saw the light."
  china.1714.t: "Sunset"
  china.1714.d: "Kim Jong-un, once one of the golden suns of North Korea, is the third-generation leader of the "Kim Dynasty". During his more than ten years in politics and leadership of North Korea, he has made certain contributions to the development of North Korea and the improvement of people's livelihood. However, at the turning point of history, some of his merits and contributions still cannot cover up the problems of the entire system and system of North Korea. His own trial and characterization are the focus of this public trial.\nThe morning sun in Pyongyang was already hanging in the sky. Kim Jong-un, wearing a black suit, was escorted by Chinese PLA soldiers to the May Day Sports Center in Pyongyang. During the trial, Kim Jong-un looked at the shackles on his hands and the streets of Pyongyang from time to time. The Chinese People's Liberation Army set up isolation belts and human walls on both sides of the street. Some North Koreans outside the isolation belts stood in place and looked at the supreme dignity of the past, some rushed to the trial site, and some cursed on the side. When the sun climbed to the middle of the sky, Kim Jong-un, who had been identified, unlocked his shackles with the help of the bailiff, and then he walked into the dock. "The criminal suspect Kim Jong-un, while serving as the president of the People's Republic of Korea, During his tenure as the supreme leader, he misappropriated state property for private use, condoned and shielded factional personnel for personal gain, embezzled international aid for personal gain, and transferred state assets overseas..." When the prosecutor read out the charges, Kim Jong-un acted indifferent. After the prosecutor finished reading, Kim Jong-un looked at the judge and said, "I, the former supreme leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, plead guilty, but I don't understand why, other cadres in our country have committed these crimes, but I have to be pulled out for a separate trial. Do Chinese comrades want to swallow up North Korea?" Obviously, Kim Jong-un was pretending to be confused, or he didn't realize what his problem was at all.\n"Our country has always been adhering to the idea of ​​curing diseases and saving lives. Since you don't understand, then we have to ask the representatives of the masses to accuse you." The judge at the trial seat signaled the assistant to leave. After a few minutes, several North Koreans in different clothes entered the courtroom.\n"I am a worker in a state-owned cotton mill in North Korea. More than 40 years ago, my son was the real owner of this position, but during the difficult period of the country, the factory had no money and nothing to give to the workers. The aid originally sent by the United Nations appeared on the black market, and the government refused to allow the United Nations inspectors to enter where I was on the grounds of national security. Finally, my son stole food from the factory director’s warehouse for food, and the factory director asked the security guard to shoot him for treason. When the vacancy occurred, I was asked to fill it, otherwise I would be…” The old worker with wrinkled hands and weather-beaten face described his situation, but he just narrated it calmly, as if the matter was very far away from him. After he paused, he pointed to Kim Jong-un and said, “Why, Supreme Leader, how can this slave-like household registration and job system be like socialism? Why do you treat your people like this?” But before Kim Jong-un could reply, the old worker put on a show. He waved his hand and left quietly...\nSeveral other representatives of the masses also expressed their grievances and confusions in front of the live broadcast of the public trial, and Kim Jong-un stopped talking and moving. Did he understand? Or maybe he understood, at least he knew why the Chinese government wanted to try him, so he turned to the judge and asked, "I am very grateful to the Chinese comrades for giving me the opportunity. At least I understand why I failed and was deserted by my friends and relatives." After that, Kim Jong-un laughed, but his laughter seemed miserable and absurd, "Then, can I know the result of my trial?" "This is not made by us, but by the people of North Korea. The people of your country are watching this public trial."... As the verdict came to an end, the sun also set, and the setting sun brought hope for tomorrow."

  china.1715.t: "North Korea thaws"
  china.1715.d: "Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang\nChina and North Korea signed the "Comprehensive Cooperation Framework Agreement" in Pyongyang today. According to the agreement, China will provide North Korea with all-round technical support and development assistance in many fields such as industry, agriculture and military.\nIt is reported that the first batch of Chinese technical experts will arrive in North Korea at the end of this month. These experts will go deep into factories and farms across North Korea to help promote production process reform. Among them, Hamhung Fertilizer Plant and Kim Chaek Steel Plant will be the first batch of pilot units.\nIn the field of agriculture, China will send agricultural scientific research personnel to introduce high-quality seeds and modern agricultural tools to help North Korea increase grain production. At the same time, China will share its experience in rice breeding and farmland water conservancy construction to help North Korea's agricultural modernization process.\nIn terms of economic reform, the Chinese Economic Advisory Group will assist North Korea in formulating a reform plan that suits its national conditions. It is understood that North Korea will deepen economic cooperation with my country and explore new models of opening up to the outside world.\nIn terms of military cooperation, the People's Liberation Army will send a group of instructors to assist the Korean People's Army Promote the modernization of the army. The two sides will carry out in-depth exchanges in the fields of military training and equipment maintenance. \n In the field of education, China will train nearly 1,000 technical backbones for North Korea. These talents will receive systematic training in key Chinese universities and will become the backbone of North Korea's development in the future. \n It is worth noting that the agreement particularly emphasizes the principle of "adapting measures to local conditions, independence and autonomy, and opposing big-powerism". China will fully respect the actual situation of the DPRK and avoid mechanical imitation. \n The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, published an editorial pointing out that this cooperation has opened a new chapter in the DPRK-China relations and will inject new impetus into the economic and social development of North Korea. \n Analysts believe that this agreement reflects China's in-depth thinking on North Korea's development path. Through gradual reforms, North Korea is expected to achieve a smooth transformation of its economy and society. \n It is understood that China and North Korea will also establish a regular meeting mechanism to summarize cooperation experience in a timely manner and ensure that various measures are implemented. \n Xinhua News Agency reporter\t Li Ming"

  china.1716.d: "September 12, 2024\tSunny\nAfter five hours of bumping on the dirt road, the jeep finally arrived at Xinxingli in North Pyongan Province. The slogan "March Construction" on the mud wall at the entrance of the village was mottled and faded, which reminded me of the similar slogans on the outer wall of the supply and marketing cooperative in my hometown in the 1980s. Director Jin held my hand and said "Dongmu", which is pronounced somewhat similar to the Northeastern dialect "comrade".\nSeptember 14, 2024\tRainy\nIn the morning, I followed Choi Young-sil, a North Korean doctor who studied in my country, to make rounds. There was only half a bottle of aspirin and some miscellaneous hemostatic tools left in her medicine box, but she had to give them to the three villages. Patients see doctors and receive treatment. Passing by the village primary school classroom, a dozen children were crowded in front of desks with bricks on their legs to write, and their pencils were so short that they could hardly be held. I touched the ballpoint pen in my backpack, and couldn't help but think about which class to distribute it to first. \nSeptember 20, 2024\tCloudy\nOn the day when the mobile clinic was set up in the threshing ground, seventy-year-old Park Amani lifted up her trouser legs to show me her swollen feet. The translator Xiao Jin suddenly got stuck and was sweating anxiously. I gestured for the old man to lie down, and suddenly remembered the sketchbook in my bag - I drew a heart and outlined the kidneys next to it. Amani's turbid eyes lit up, and she nodded and pointed at herself waist. \nOctober 5, 2024\tSunny\nWhen the first batch of greenhouse vegetables sprouted, the village organized the Korean Red Guards to guard them overnight. Technician Xiao Liu taught the cadres and farmers sent by North Korea to use straw ash to prevent insects. Forty-year-old squad leader Li drew circles on his notebook like a primary school student. In the evening, when I was leaving work and passing by the medical station, I saw Dr. Cui practicing acupuncture with a book on a human model. There were seven or eight women holding children lined up outside the faded blue cloth curtain. \nNovember 2, 2024\tSnow\nOn the eve of the return trip, Director Jin sent an enamel jar wrapped in red cloth. When I opened it, it was dried pollack, and the fishy smell was mixed with The salty sea breeze. The children from the village primary school stood in two lines at the entrance of the village, shouting "Thank you Chinese comrades" in the Chinese language they had just learned. When the jeep started, the corner of Dr. Cui's white coat flashed in the rearview mirror. She was carrying the medicine box we donated and was walking to other villages in the valley. On the way back, we passed the Taedong River, and fish were vaguely seen wagging their tails under the thin ice. I looked at the enamel pot in my arms and suddenly remembered that on the eve of leaving home, my father said that when he went to Pyongyang to help build a textile factory in 1992, the North Korean workers always secretly put the eggs for lunch into the lunch boxes of the Chinese technicians. Thirty years have passed, and this warmth is still flowing quietly under the frozen land. "

  china.1717.t: "Meeting in the Forest"
  china.1717.d: "In the twilight of the Ganges Plain, a PLA squad was advancing along a hidden mountain road. They were dressed in plain clothes, carrying camouflaged equipment, and walking on this strange and ancient land.\nCaptain Ju Zizhou glanced at the military multi-function instrument on his wrist, which showed that they had arrived at the scheduled meeting point. He took out the communication terminal, and the PLA soldiers immediately dispersed and stood alert in a combat posture. Then he quickly connected to the agreed frequency band.\n"The hands of workers," he said in English, "can smash all shackles."\n"The farmer's sickle," the radio responded, "will harvest the oppressed rice ears."\nThree minutes later, there was a rustling sound in the forest, and dozens of figures quietly appeared. They were men and women, wearing relatively uniform green coarse cloth uniforms, holding a variety of rifles in their hands. The leader was a dark-skinned young man.\nAfter the PLA and the guerrilla fighters saluted each other, "Hello, comrades. "The young man spoke first in English with a slight accent, "I am Rahul, the director of international affairs of the Bihar-Jharkhand Special Regional Committee." \n"Hello, comrades." Ju Zizhou stepped forward, "I am Ju Zizhou, the captain of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's advance team to aid India." \nThe two shook hands. In the dim light, their eyes flashed with a similar light. It was a tacit understanding that transcended language, skin color and national boundaries. \nRahul's team members gathered around and looked at the equipment of the PLA soldiers curiously. A young guerrilla smiled in broken English: "Comrades, you are really on time, not early or late at all." \n"Yes," a PLA soldier replied with a smile, "The People's Liberation Army strictly implements combat orders and arrives when they are told to! ”\nAlthough there was a language barrier, simple gestures and sincere smiles resolved the unfamiliarity. The two sides, who were a little awkward at the beginning, soon put down their airs and began to share gifts with each other. A guerrilla handed over a bag of homemade Indian tea from the base, and the PLA soldiers took out carefully prepared Chinese knots from their backpacks.\n"Comrades," Ju Zizhou explained in English, "this is our traditional Chinese handicraft, and each knot represents a different meaning. This long knot," he pointed to the complex pattern woven from red ropes, "symbolizes eternity and unity. May we be as closely connected as this rope and witness the dawn of victory together. "\nRahul and the soldiers carefully took the Chinese knot, and gently stroked the delicate patterns with their fingers. "Thank you," he said, "we will definitely carry it with us until the day of the victory of the revolution. ”\nAs the night deepened, wisps of smoke rose from the forest. A simple curry rice was cooking in the pot, and the aroma filled the forest. The bonfire reflected everyone's face. Although their facial features were distinct, they were all lit up by the same fire of ideals.\nSomeone suddenly hummed a familiar melody in a low voice. It was the tune of "The Internationale". Soon, more voices joined in. Some sang in Chinese, some in Hindi, and some in English. Different languages, but conveying the same belief.\n"Arise, ye workers from your slumber..."\n"Arise, ye workers from your slumber..."\nThe singing echoed in the jungle, startling a few night birds.\n"Tomorrow," Rahul pointed to the mountains in the distance and said when the singing subsided, "we will go there to carry out our mission."\nJu Zizhou nodded: "Let's go together. For the liberation of the working people and the destruction of the oppressors. "\nThat night, in the vast jungles of India, a group of warriors from different countries are writing a new chapter of internationalism in the new era."

  china.1719.d: "We have finally completed this huge project.\nFrom the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the foot of the Tianshan Mountains, a modern defense system has been built. This is not the ancient Great Wall built with bricks and stones, but a three-dimensional defense network composed of radar stations, defense fortresses, underground fortifications, anti-missile systems and mobile forces.\nIn the northeast, the new air defense missile system and the domestically produced Hongqi-19 missile form a double air defense network. The underground command post is hundreds of meters underground, and the command system can remain intact even if it is hit by a nuclear attack. The new long-range strategic radar can detect any air target 6,000 kilometers away.\nOn the Mongolian defense line, we have established a multi-level mobile defense system. The hundreds of kilometers of underground channel network allows armored forces to complete strategic deployment before the enemy detects it. Distributed supply bases ensure that the front-line troops can maintain their combat effectiveness even after being hit.\nIn the northwest , we have established a series of hidden military facilities deep in the Gobi Desert. The satellite navigation jammer system can render the enemy's precision-guided weapons ineffective. The underground airport can protect the air force in wartime, and a large number of bomber formations are enough to paralyze the transportation blood vessels of the "Big Bear" in Central Asia and Siberia. \nThis project, which cost hundreds of billions of dollars, mobilized more than one million builders and used the latest military technology. It is not only a military defense line, but also a political declaration: we are ready. \nThe latest assessment of the General Staff believes that this new Great Wall can allow our army to gain at least a week of strategic maneuvering time when it is attacked suddenly. This is of great significance for a possible two-front combat situation. \nI hope this line of defense will never be used. But if that day comes, it will make any enemy who attempts to invade our territory pay a heavy price. "

  china.1720.d: "Pyongyang, 4:00 a.m. When the first air defense alarm sounded on the front line, Kim Jong-ho, commander of the 1st Motorized Infantry Brigade of the Capital of the Korean People's Army, was making the final deployment with Major General Zhang, head of the Advisory Group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. "The time has come." Major General Zhang glanced at his watch, "Are all the units in place?" "The 1st Motorized Infantry Brigade is in place." Kim Jong-ho nodded, "The 4th Motorized Infantry Brigade and the Capital Light Infantry Regiment are also waiting for the signal." "Very good." Major General Zhang pressed the call button, "Operation code: Dawn." At the general's mansion, two guards on duty quietly opened the courtyard gate. The captain of the guard, who had long been turned against, turned off the electronic monitoring system. The special operations team sneaked into the building like a ghost. In the master bedroom, Kim Jong-un was sleeping soundly. When he was awakened by the hurried footsteps, it was too late. The special operations forces had already blocked all retreat routes. "Don't move! "The captain said in a low voice.\nThirty minutes later, the main organs in Pyongyang had been controlled. The reformist officers in the People's Army who had been prepared for a long time quickly took over the command system. No Kwang-tie, Jiang Chun-nam and others were isolated for investigation. There was no bloodshed, no chaos, and everything was done quietly.\nWhen the first ray of sunlight illuminated the sky over Pyongyang, the new Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army had been established, and news of swearing allegiance from various troops came one after another. Kim Jong-ho watched Major General Zhang pack up the items on his desk.\n"Are you leaving now?"\n"Yes," Major General Zhang smiled, "This is your country, and you should govern it. Our mission has been completed."\n"Thank you." Kim Jong-ho shook Major General Zhang's hand, "Thank you comrades for helping us get rid of the cage."\n"You're welcome, comrade."

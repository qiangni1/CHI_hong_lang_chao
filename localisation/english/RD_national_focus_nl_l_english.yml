#### Before CPC 20th Conference ####

#########National Policy for Epidemic########
PRC_lockdown_wuhan: "Wuhan Lockdown"
PRC_lockdown_wuhan_desc: "As panic spreads further, the situation has gradually become out of control. Since CCTV reported that "a new infectious coronavirus has been discovered", the entire Hubei Province, centered on Wuhan, has shown signs of a large-scale exodus of people. Citizens are scrambling to escape the city, and the highways are crowded, almost causing traffic to come to a complete standstill. If we sit back and do nothing, more cases of virus infection will be found in hospitals across the country within a few days. We must act decisively and order a nationwide lockdown of Wuhan now."
PRC_nationwide_lockdown: "National Epidemic Lockdown"
PRC_nationwide_lockdown_desc: "This will be unprecedented in the history of public health. In order to control the epidemic as soon as possible, China will enter a "quasi-wartime system" across the country, with strict restrictions on travel and transportation to curb the spread of the virus. Citizens who are unfortunately infected with the coronavirus will be concentrated in hospitals and temporary medical stations for unified isolation and treatment. At the same time, medical scientists and biologists across the country are mobilized to work together to find the ultimate way to defeat the virus."
PRC_implement_emergency_measures: "Take emergency measures"
PRC_implement_emergency_measures_desc: "At this time of national crisis, all citizens should share weal and woe. However, many morally corrupt anti-party elements and speculators have taken the opportunity to disrupt the situation, spread rumors to discredit the Party and the government, and undermine our efforts to control the situation in various places. We don't need to be polite to these people. The people's police will be dispatched immediately to crack down on illegal vendors who hoard and sell medicines and masks at high prices. At the same time, stricter Internet controls will be implemented to prevent people from being wrongly incited."
PRC_implement_widespread_testing: "Promote nucleic acid testing"
PRC_implement_widespread_testing_desc: "Nucleic acid testing is not only low-cost and easy to promote, but also can help us diagnose whether the human body is infected with the coronavirus with higher efficiency, which plays a very critical role in timely treatment of patients, epidemic monitoring and control, and economic and normal life recovery. We will promote nucleic acid testing projects across the country and build multiple testing sites in major cities. First of all, government employees, and in the future, all citizens and even all citizens will be tested."
PRC_economic_stability_policy: "Economic Stability Policy"
PRC_economic_stability_policy_desc: "The new crown epidemic has had a significant impact on my country's normal economic order and production activities, and has seriously slowed down my country's economic growth rate. In a sense, the coronavirus may prevent us from achieving our goal of building a socialist modern power by the middle of this century. Now that the world is trapped by the virus, and my country's epidemic has been initially effectively suppressed, it is time to get the country back on track in economic construction. Taking this opportunity, my country will also further consolidate its position as the "world factory."
PRC_zero_covid_policy: "Implement the zero-covid policy"
PRC_zero_covid_policy_desc: "If we cannot protect people's lives from the threat of the virus, the legitimacy of the Party and the government will be seriously questioned. In addition, the strict measures we took in the early stage of the virus spread have also proved to be quite effective. Anyone who wants China to relax restrictions and return to normal now either does not realize the horror of the virus or has ulterior motives. We will continue to implement the zero-COVID policy, just as the General Secretary said: "People first, life first." "
PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model: "Learn from the Swedish model"
PRC_adopt_the_swedish_model_desc: "As the first country in the world to officially announce the end of the epidemic, Sweden's epidemic prevention policy has also attracted the attention of governments around the world. Some health officials and medical experts in my country have also suggested that we can learn from the advanced experience of the Swedes, including relaxing restrictions on people entering and leaving public places, stopping the public statistics of confirmed cases, and not requiring non-medical personnel or high-risk groups to undergo mandatory nucleic acid testing. This will help my country return to normal faster when the virus's infectiousness and toxicity decrease in the future."
PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research: "Start vaccine research and development"
PRC_kickstart_vaccine_research_desc: "We will issue an order as soon as possible, requiring biological research institutes and pharmaceutical companies across the country to immediately start research and testing of new coronavirus disease vaccines. This is not only to control the epidemic faster, but also an important means to enhance my country's international reputation and expand its influence. At present, there are many inactivated vaccines developed by Sinovac Biotech, including one undergoing clinical trials. At the same time, we have also issued a statement to the World Health Organization and developing countries, expressing our willingness to donate vaccines and provide scientific research assistance."
PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures: "Adopt strict lockdown measures"
PRC_adopt_strict_lockdown_measures_desc: "Despite psychological preparation, the contagiousness of the coronavirus is still beyond our imagination. We can only further strengthen monitoring measures and invest more resources to control the flow of people within the city, urban and rural areas, and in and out of the country to the minimum. Some people accuse us of "forcing the entire country to shut down", but in order to defeat the epidemic, the lockdown policy will prove to be necessary."
PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development: "Focus on vaccine research and development"
PRC_focus_on_vaccine_development_desc: "Only by developing a reliable vaccine can we truly control the spread of the coronavirus at the source. At present, the vaccine research and development work of biopharmaceutical companies, led by Sinovac Biotech, has achieved decisive results. We must make good use of the funds and resources at hand, further support the efforts of enterprises to develop vaccines, and put the results into use as soon as possible to ensure that citizens can eventually be free from infection."
PRC_focus_on_mask_production: "Focus on mask production"
PRC_focus_on_mask_production_desc: "Medical masks are not only low-cost, but also can be mass-produced on a large scale and can be shipped to all parts of the country very conveniently. The sufficient supply of masks is also one of the important reasons why we can stabilize the epidemic. The State Council will further invest funds to expand the production scale of medical masks, especially to provide technical support and subsidies to mask manufacturers in areas with severe epidemics."
PRC_food_safety_reforms: "Food safety reforms"
PRC_food_safety_reforms_desc: "Given that this unfortunate outbreak was caused by a "patient zero" who ate wild game, now is the time to make drastic reforms to our food safety and food hygiene systems. We will not only introduce legislation to completely eradicate the bad habit of eating wild animals, but also promote more hygienic table manners to reduce the possibility of virus transmission in public places. In addition, we will further invest in industrial processed food and fast food production to make them more hygienic and safe."
PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing: "State surveillance of close contacts"
PRC_surveillance_state_contact_tracing_desc: "We began to use the "Health Code" location tracking application after the outbreak of the epidemic as an individual's electronic pass and reliable proof of health status, as well as displaying the user's personal epidemic risk level. Only when the government has full control over the real-time tracking of high-risk groups can it formulate epidemic prevention policies more effectively, while ensuring that vital national security information and citizens' personal information are not leaked."
PRC_outsource_contact_tracing: "Outsource close contact monitoring work"
PRC_outsource_contact_tracing_desc: "We started using the "Health Code" location tracking application after the outbreak as an electronic pass for individuals and reliable proof of health status, as well as to display the user's personal epidemic risk level. In order to reduce the government's administrative pressure and cost expenditure, we can choose to hand over the operation of the "Health Code" to trusted private Internet companies, so that they can share the pressure."
PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies: "Funding herd immunity research"
PRC_fund_crowd_immunity_studies_desc: "With the continuous increase in vaccination rates, the immunity of the people to the new coronavirus has been significantly enhanced. One of the important bases of the herd immunity theory is that the higher the proportion of the population with immunity, the easier it is to cut off the chain of infection of the disease transmitted between individuals, and the impact of the national epidemic can gradually disappear. We will begin to instruct our medical scientists and major media to carry out theoretical preparations and publicity work before implementing the herd immunity policy, laying a solid foundation for policy shifts."
PRC_blame_the_americans: "blame the United States"
PRC_blame_the_americans_desc: "We must find scapegoats for the mistakes and confusion in epidemic prevention. For that matter, is there anyone more suitable to blame than the United States? Long-standing nationalist anti-American propaganda and fear of American power will make most citizens very easy to believe in various conspiracy theories. We will spread the word through the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, blaming the biological experiments conducted by the Americans at Fort Detrick as the culprit of the new crown epidemic, and the US military delegation for bringing the virus to Wuhan."
PRC_blame_local_officials: "Blame local officials"
PRC_blame_local_officials_desc: "We must find scapegoats for the mistakes and confusion in epidemic prevention. We can use the people's hatred of corrupt bureaucrats and lazy cadres to launch a new round of anti-corruption campaign. The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection will conduct a comprehensive review of the work and documents of governments at all levels in the past few years, focusing on cracking down on local cadres who are not active in implementing central policies and have improper relations with pharmaceutical companies. Taking this opportunity, we can also place more confidants in the government."
PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net: "Expand the social safety net"
PRC_expand_the_social_safety_net_desc: "The epidemic has taught us a meaningful lesson. Across the country, many people have been killed by the virus, and these people are precisely the poor people who are out of touch with society, and most of them are elderly people. Whether in rural areas or cities, the situation is similar, which deeply exposes the shortcomings of our country's social security system. If we want to achieve the goal of common prosperity set by the Party, we must formulate more complete social security policies and provide more timely assistance to those in need."
PRC_return_to_normalcy: "Return to normalcy"
PRC_return_to_normalcy_desc: "After years of hard work, today, we can finally announce to the people of the country and the world that China has stepped out of the era of the new coronavirus pandemic and officially returned to normalcy. This is not only a victory for the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China, but also a great victory for the 1.4 billion Chinese people!"

PRC_expand_belt_road: "One Belt, One Road"

#####True National Policy#####
PRC_the_man_death: "The man has passed away"
PRC_the_man_death_desc: "With the death of Premier Li Keqiang, the administrative machinery that has been overloaded by the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil crisis is now on the verge of collapse. The public's dissatisfaction and protests have added fuel to the fire. Perhaps China's giant ship needs to adjust its course or even change its helmsman to cope with the crises that are coming one after another..."
PRC_a_broken_system: "Broken System"
PRC_a_broken_system_desc: "We must admit that the heavy blow of the oil crisis has clearly proved the inadequacy and fragility of the existing system. Heavy punishments should be used to govern troubled times. We will accept more radical reform policies and make drastic revisions to the old system. Only in this way can we usher in China's true revival."
PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production: "Expand domestic oil production"
PRC_expand_domestic_oil_production_desc: "At such a critical moment, we can no longer rely on unstable overseas oil import channels. We will further exploit our domestic resource reserves and build more oil drilling and processing plants. Only in this way can energy security be truly in our own hands, while also reducing the transportation cost of fuel and further alleviating the impact of the economic crisis."
PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade: "Diversify the oil trade"
PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade_desc: "When the world's major oil-producing countries are in turmoil and chaos, ensuring the security and stability of our energy import channels is crucial to alleviating the crisis. Thanks to our friendly relations with developing countries over the years, we can more easily open up more oil import channels, such as importing oil from Venezuela and Brunei, thereby diversifying risks."
PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil: "Drilling Xinjiang Oil"
PRC_drill_for_xinjiang_oil_desc: "The vast Xinjiang region has been engaged in oil extraction for a long time, but due to its remote location and sparse population, the oil extracted locally cannot be properly used. Now, with the construction of oil pipelines and the approval of new oil extraction contracts at the fastest speed, Xinjiang oil has become the lifeline for maintaining my country's economy."
PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere: "Stabilize the economy"
PRC_stabilize_the_economic_sphere_desc: "The impact of the oil crisis on my country's economy can be resolved through a variety of means. The Chinese government will issue decrees to limit the growth rate of fuel prices, establish oil consumption coupons to limit the consumption of inventories, and increase relief funds and bonds for economically distressed areas to curb economic recession. Through a two-pronged approach of various policy measures, let people realize that we have the ability to stabilize the economy."
PRC_seek_system_change: "Seek institutional change"
PRC_seek_system_change_desc: "Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, the Party's work has shifted from class struggle to economic construction. As my country's economy develops rapidly, the gap between the rich and the poor has gradually widened to a point that cannot be ignored. The people's surging dissatisfaction and the crises that followed have exposed the shortcomings of the existing system. For the welfare of the people and the survival of the Party's ideals, the cadres headed by Comrade Hu Chunhua seek to reform the existing system to make it more in line with my country's socialist national conditions."
PRC_found_united_front: "Establish a united front"
PRC_found_united_front_desc: "Since the reform and opening up, the old leftists of the Mao era who are dissatisfied with the unfair distribution and the widening gap between the rich and the poor, the new leftists who emerged with the deepening of reform and opening up, the idealistic young people in the cadre team who yearn for the Mao era, the officers in the army who insist on serving the people's ideals and beliefs...even the pro-labor small entrepreneurs are our natural allies. We will use the important magic weapon of the Party - the united front to unite them and bring them closer to our alliance to change the status quo."
PRC_in_the_name_of_people: "In the name of the people"
PRC_in_the_name_of_people_desc: "The class contradictions exacerbated by reform and opening up have been exposed by the sharp economic decline. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the oil crisis has caused this express train to fall off a cliff. The surging confrontational sentiment is reverberating among the people, and the inaction of the upper echelons has made the people even more angry. Therefore, we will charge against the supreme power in the name of the people."
PRC_promise_a_new_spring: "The promise of a new spring"
PRC_promise_a_new_spring_desc: "In a recent private meeting, Premier Hu Chunhua has promised to relax control over speech and carry out fairer economic policy reforms after taking office. The members of the alliance all expressed their support. Next, we will make a promise to the people, a promise of a better spring. The Premier's magnanimous attitude inherited from former President Hu Jintao can also calm the surging public opinion, let them continue to believe in the government, and lay the foundation for public support for our reforms."
PRC_prepare_for_the_20th: "Prepare for the 20th National Congress"
PRC_prepare_for_the_20th_desc: "The past is over. Xi Jinping has reached an agreement with us that he will not seek re-election and will connect with us. We will start preparing documents, checking data, and meeting with reporters and NPC representatives. At the same time, we will prepare to open the "inauguration gifts" prepared for us."
PRC_shake_up_the_politburo_2: "The 20th National Congress"
PRC_shake_up_the_politburo_2_desc: "We will finally hold the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, elect a new Central Committee and determine the focus of the party's work for the next five years. Many people at home and abroad are very concerned about the results of this congress, and we will also use this opportunity to show the party's strength, unity and change."
PRC_diversify_the_oil_trade_dummy: "Diversify the oil trade"
PRC_reinforce_drilling_oil_dummy: "Expand oil drilling"
PRC_a_energy_revolution: "Energy revolution"
PRC_a_energy_revolution_desc: "We cannot simply hope to restore oil imports to ease our domestic energy crisis. By investing in nuclear and renewable energy, we will rely on new-age energy to power our economy and industry."

################# Taiwan Strait War National Focus #################

PRC_the_final_opportunity: "The last chance"
PRC_the_final_opportunity_desc: "After more than 70 years of stalemate, with the United States now in civil strife, the biggest obstacle to the reunification of the motherland has finally disappeared. Although many Asia-Pacific countries, led by Japan, claim that they will work together to ensure the status quo in the Taiwan Strait, they cannot match our country in terms of economic scale and military strength, and without the leadership of the United States, it is difficult for them to truly unite. For this reason, now is the best time for us to launch the struggle to liberate Taiwan, and such an opportunity may never come again in the future."
PRC_prepare_landing_craft: "Prepare landing craft"
PRC_prepare_landing_craft_desc: "Amphibious landing capability has always been the focus of the PLA's military construction. Since the 1990s, we have bought engines and ship design drawings specifically for large landing craft from Russia, Ukraine and other countries. After entering the new century, the PLA Navy also imitated the US Navy to build and put into service a considerable fleet of amphibious assault ships. We will secretly mobilize these ships and deploy them to the sailing positions along the coast of Fujian and Zhejiang Provinces."
PRC_modern_combined_arms: "Modern combined operations"
PRC_modern_combined_arms_desc: "After in-depth research on the military operations of the United States and Russia, we have a clearer understanding of the complexity of modern warfare. The Taiwan Strait Campaign requires close cooperation between the PLA Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as the Rocket Force and the Armed Police Force. According to the theory of modern combined operations, information sharing between different services and arms, and unified obedience to the command of the Central Military Commission are also crucial."
PRC_blockade_taiwan: "Blockade Taiwan"
PRC_blockade_taiwan_desc: "We will set up a no-fly zone around Taiwan Island and send frigates and submarines to patrol designated sea boundaries day and night. Air routes directly to Taiwan Island will also be closely monitored. This is not only to disperse the interference of civilian ships and civil aviation and clear obstacles for the PLA's sea and air attacks, but also to cut off Taiwan's economic sources and shake the rule of the island government. Some countries may condemn this and claim that our actions will lead to a humanitarian crisis in Taiwan, but as long as Taiwan collapses, everything will end soon."
PRC_conduct_final_training: "Holding the final exercise"
PRC_conduct_final_training_desc: "Not only is the naval fleet training intensively for the Taiwan Strait campaign, the PLA's vanguard troops are also conducting final landing exercises on the Liaodong Peninsula and Hainan Island. At the same time, at the inland training base, the first batch of airborne troops and special forces scheduled to land on Taiwan Island have also begun assault training related to infiltration operations. All of this is to enable us to respond to the war in the best condition when the flames of war are really ignited."
PRC_expand_the_j20_program: "Expand the J20 Program"
PRC_expand_the_j20_program_desc: "The J20 is a fifth-generation stealth fighter developed by the People's Liberation Army Air Force. It is one of the most advanced and powerful fighters in the world. In addition, our growing aviation industry has solved the technical bottlenecks that have plagued us for many years. Now we have all the conditions for mass production of the J20, and we can also manufacture improved models equipped with more advanced engines or using better stealth coatings as required."
PRC_operation_silent_dawn: "§YOperation Silent Dawn§!"
PRC_operation_silent_dawn_desc: "The critical moment has finally arrived: we will launch Operation Silent Dawn, which is an important step in determining the success of our combat plan. Ballistic missiles and rocket artillery commanded by the Rocket Force will launch a preemptive strike on Taiwan's key military facilities, such as airfields, anti-aircraft missiles and radar stations, completely destroying their early warning capabilities. In addition, the missiles will also target power stations and substations, as well as important communication centers."
PRC_sieze_kinmen: "Seize Kinmen"
PRC_sieze_kinmen_desc: "The Kinmen Islands are adjacent to Xiamen, Fujian, and are one of the important outposts of the Taiwan military. If we want to launch a landing operation in Taiwan, we must first take Kinmen, destroy Taiwan's outer defense system, and provide an important forward base and transit station for the landing troops. Not only that, occupying Kinmen will also wash away the shame of our disastrous defeat in the Kinmen Campaign more than 70 years ago."
PRC_plan_on_high_alert: "The PLA Navy is on high alert"
PRC_plan_on_high_alert_desc: "After our navy began to carry out blockade and patrol missions in the Taiwan Strait, one of the important tasks undertaken by the fleet was to be vigilant against possible breakout attempts by Taiwan naval ships and to guard against harassment actions from hostile forces such as the US Pacific Fleet and the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Not only that, our coast guard also played an important role, intercepting several smuggling attempts by Taiwanese merchant ships and refugee ships."
PRC_finish_what_mao_started: "Complete Chairman Mao's unfinished business"
PRC_finish_what_mao_started_desc: "During the Mao era, there was a famous slogan: "We must plant the flag of victory in Taiwan." However, until Chairman Mao died in 1976, he did not live to see Taiwan return to the embrace of the motherland. Now we will put together the last piece of the puzzle of the great cause started by Mao. We will officially declare war on the puppet government occupying Taiwan. The last battle of the Liberation War has begun!"
PRC_analyze_first_days: "First Day Analysis"
PRC_analyze_first_days_desc: "Our preliminary preparations for the war seem to have achieved the desired effect: Operation Silent Dawn and the naval blockade have almost successfully destroyed Taiwan's counterattack force and reduced the morale of the Taiwanese people to the lowest point. But we must also admit that the Taiwan reactionaries have not been completely destroyed. Its air force and submarines that were fortunately not destroyed launched a relatively successful counterattack, causing some losses. At the command center of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, our generals will review the situation on the first day of the battle and formulate the next combat plan."
PRC_fast_finalization: "Speed ​​is of the essence"
PRC_fast_finalization_desc: "Seizing precious strategic opportunities is one of the important rules of war. This attack on Taiwan is no exception. After the missile bombing and air strikes are over, we will order the landing fleet to set off immediately and establish several stable bridgeheads on the west coast of Taiwan Island to prevent the Taiwanese army from launching a counterattack. The PLA Navy's aircraft carrier battle group will also operate in the waters east of Taiwan and attack important strongholds on the east coast of Taiwan. The real battle has only begun now."
PRC_slowly_but_surely: "Seeking progress while maintaining stability"
PRC_slowly_but_surely_desc: "Given that we already have an absolute advantage in manpower, the most important thing to do now is to avoid over-optimism and reckless and aggressive emotions that will undermine the entire strategic plan. We should continue to expand the advantages brought to us by surprise attacks, and require our special forces deployed on Taiwan Island to intensify their activities to interfere with the troop mobilization and strength recovery of the Taiwanese army. At the same time, a new round of large-scale missile attacks will be put on the agenda to consolidate our military and psychological advantages over the Taiwanese army."
PRC_air_deconservation: "All Out"
PRC_air_deconservation_desc: "Although the Taiwan Air Force is far smaller than the PLA Air Force, it has several advanced equipment, including F-16 fighters, and its pilots are often more professional and determined than their army and navy counterparts. To this end, we will send slightly inferior but still combat-capable fighters to participate in the air war against Taiwan. Faced with such a large number of air forces, the Pacific Organization's forces will definitely not be able to cope."
PRC_adapt_to_current_realities_of_battles: "Adapt to Modern Combat"
PRC_adapt_to_current_realities_of_battles_desc: "Despite years of military modernization, the People's Liberation Army still exposed many problems in the Taiwan Strait Campaign, which is largely due to our underestimation of the modern warfare model and the lack of actual combat experience of the army after decades of peace. We will learn valuable lessons from this war, summarize classic battle examples, and use them as research topics for the National Defense University to find new military principles to guide the next war."
PRC_crackdown_on_separatists: "Crackdown on Separatists"
PRC_crackdown_on_separatists_desc: "As we recover more and more of Taiwan, it is time to deal with the people of Taiwan. Our goal is to identify those anti-communists and Taiwanese separatists who are hiding, so the focus of investigation will be on citizens' relevant speech and Internet usage records. In addition, unauthorized political gatherings and mass activities will be temporarily strictly restricted, and those who disobey martial law orders will be punished accordingly."
PRC_indiscriminate_missile_strikes: "Indiscriminate Missile Strikes"
PRC_indiscriminate_missile_strikes_desc: "As our military operations against Taiwan enter a new phase, it is time to relax the final restrictions on the Rocket Force. All missile units aimed at Taiwan will be allowed to launch strikes against any suspected hostile targets on the island, especially those civilian buildings that may be used as secret bases for small Taiwanese military units and strategically located nature reserves. This is a necessary sacrifice for the ultimate victory."
PRC_taiwanese_affairs_dont_concern_mainland: "Taiwanese affairs have nothing to do with the mainland"
PRC_taiwanese_affairs_dont_concern_mainland_desc: "While our army is still fighting hard on the island of Taiwan, we must ensure that order in our rear area, the mainland, remains stable. Since the beginning of the war, several provinces in the coastal areas have been put on a state of war readiness, but apart from that, there is no need for us to put more areas of the mainland into a wartime system. At the same time, news about the war in Taiwan will also be monitored and controlled to ensure that the public's support for the war does not change."
PRC_final_offensive: "Final Offensive"
PRC_final_offensive_desc: "After a long and bitter battle, we have finally surrounded the last threatening resistance in Taiwan in the Taipei metropolitan area. Although there are still some stragglers in the mountainous areas, as long as we successfully occupy Taipei, the war will be over. Although the People's Liberation Army will inevitably suffer heavy losses, when the soldiers can already see the spire of Taipei 101 through the telescope, the desire for victory has overwhelmed all fears of failure!"
PRC_unite_people: "Unite the masses"
PRC_unite_people_desc: "In addition to dealing with the enemies lurking among the people, we will also mobilize the masses to actively carry out counter-espionage activities. Not only that, in order to make them realize the superiority of the socialist system and establish a sense of belonging to the new regime, we will actively carry out economic assistance and reconstruction work in Taiwan, while giving Taiwanese residents many policy benefits and encouraging them to obtain Chinese citizen identity documents as soon as possible."
PRC_minimize_civilian_casualties: "Minimize civilian casualties"
PRC_minimize_civilian_casualties_desc: "Although street fighting in Taiwan's urban clusters is the last thing we want to see, sometimes it is necessary to clear the enemy from their strongholds street by street and house by house to ensure complete control of the position. Although such fighting often results in high casualties, it is necessary to minimize civilian casualties. Not only that, we have also drawn up a list of targets that the army is strictly prohibited from attacking before the war, including schools, kindergartens, cemeteries, etc."
PRC_economic_conversion_to_military_needs: "Economic transformation, military needs first"
PRC_economic_conversion_to_military_needs_desc: "For a long time, China's economic growth has been extremely dependent on foreign trade. But now with the outbreak of the Taiwan Strait War, one international sanctions after another has followed, and the fact that the waters of the Western Pacific have been blockaded, we must completely transform the economic system to the track of internal circulation. With the defense industry as the core, we will establish a new economic system with serving the war as the highest goal."
PRC_no_hurry: "Don't be impatient"
PRC_no_hurry_desc: "As we fight the final battle, we must not forget the need to deploy naval and air forces to guard the periphery of Taiwan to prevent other countries from intervening in the war. In addition, we cannot accept that they will take this opportunity to assist the leaders of the pseudo-government in Taiwan to flee or establish a government in exile, which will cause endless troubles for our subsequent rule. Therefore, even if the progress of the final battle is slowed down, we must eliminate all possible political risks."

##########National Policy after Switching Lines########
PRC_nl_ancestor_worship: "Phoenix Nirvana"
PRC_nl_ancestor_worship_desc: "We did it! We completed Chairman Mao Zedong's unfinished business!\nThe top and the bottom share the same desire, and we share the same hardships. The nearly one hundred years of cross-strait grievances finally ended with the collapse of the pseudo-government entrenched in Taiwan.\n\nThe tide is rising, the tide is rising, the dead phoenix is ​​reborn!\n Fire is you, fire is me, fire is him, fire is fire!\nAfter completely destroying all the corruption entrenched in the motherland, the phoenix named China is reborn again\n\nWe are no longer tired boatmen, we are angry waves!\n\nSpread your wings again,\nthe red fire phoenix named the People's Republic of China,\nwith Chairman Mao Zedong's expectations, fly to that bright new world!"
PRC_nl_martial_law_reconstruction: "Martial Law during Reconstruction"
PRC_nl_martial_law_reconstruction_desc: "The smoke has cleared, but the war is not over.\n\nCountless puppet troops, lackeys of the imperialists, and reactionary secret societies are attacking us from all sides, dragging the masses who do not know the truth.\n\nWe need to take drastic measures quickly to restore order in Taiwan. Although some people may disagree with this, if we cannot even provide a stable society for our compatriots on the island, what liberation can we talk about?"
PRC_nl_public_trial_separatists: "Public trial of separatists"
PRC_nl_public_trial_separatists_desc: "Are the separatists disgusting and despised just because they receive aid from the imperialists and then keep jumping up and down?\n\nNo, the most disgusting thing about them is that they are willing to abruptly separate the Chinese people from the big family of the Chinese nation for their own conspiracy.\nUnder the banner of so-called independence, they actually turn around and sell the land to foreigners,\ndispersing the Chinese people.\n\nThis is the most sinful and intolerable behavior, and we must make it clear to the public."
PRC_nl_industry_integration_with_mainland: "Rectify the situation in Taiwan"
PRC_nl_industry_integration_with_mainland_desc: "Decades of separation have brought many bad consequences. The evil imperialists have created a deep rift between the Chinese people, who share the same origin. Even if we live under the same flag now, we cannot truly integrate with each other.

At the same time, the strategic support force should also maintain its excellent performance in the Taiwan Strait, projecting core capabilities such as electromagnetic suppression, network attack and defense, and satellite confrontation to the world.

PRC_Lib_Stage_loc2_2: "The international communist movement has fallen into a §Ytrough§!, like a barely visible glimmer of light in a §1dark night§!. Communist parties in various countries are §Ydisorganized§!, and some have even §3changed their flags§!; Marxism-Leninism has been buried, and revolutionary ideals have been abandoned; §3revisionism§! and §Yopportunism§! are prevalent. The few organizations that adhere to Marxism-Leninism have fallen into a §tserious split, attacking each other§!, and have lost their influence among the working class. The ideological offensive of imperialism is unprecedentedly fierce, and reactionary views such as §3"the end of history"§! and §2"the failure of socialism"§! are rampant. If no change is made, the situation will be §Adisastrous...§!"
PRC_Lib_Stage_loc2_3: "At present, the international communist movement is showing a §Gstable and improving§! trend.

Although the reactionary forces of various countries are §3strong on the surface§!, they cannot eradicate the §tdesire for liberation§! in the hearts of the people. Although the international communist movement has §Ysuffered setbacks§! in some areas, theoretical exploration and practical innovation §thave never stopped§!. The seeds of revolution have been sown, and only the spring breeze blows and the rain water nourishes. The flowers of ideals will §Rbreak out of the ground and bloom at the right time.§!"
PRC_Lib_Stage_loc2_4: "The flames of §tclass struggle§! in various countries illuminate the night sky. In many countries, the §tworking class§! has seized power and become a new §trevolution export§! base. §tproletarian§! comrades, under the leadership of §RCommunist Parties§! in various countries, are attacking the defenses of §3capitalism§! with unprecedented determination. §Gcracks are emerging within the imperialist camp§!, and the panic of the ruling class§t is growing day by day. §!People's armed forces are rising rapidly in many countries. The international communist movement has shown §Gstrong vitality§!, and the revolutionary forces of various countries have supported each other and advanced and retreated together, winning the widespread trust and support of oppressed nations and people around the world. §YImperialism is still resisting, but the revolution is unstoppable.§!"
PRC_Lib_Stage_loc2_5: "The tide of world revolution has become §Rawesome§!, sweeping across every corner of the globe. The vanguards of various countries and the Communists of various countries are closely united and §Rworking in unison§! to advance the process of world revolution. From Asia to Africa, from Latin America to Europe, red flags are everywhere, and the masses are throwing themselves into the §Rrevolutionary torrent§! with overwhelming force. Capitalist forces are retreating step by step, and the iron torrent of the proletariat is §Runstoppable.§! The dawn of victory is already shining on the horizon, and the §Ygreat victory§! of the world revolution is just around the corner."

The_Roar_of_Africa_desc: "In Africa, an ancient truth is being rediscovered: everyone can be a gentleman. Sankara proved this with words, actions and even life, and now this belief is spreading throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Africans are no longer willing to accept the label of "inferior". They want to rewrite their destiny with their own hands. This is not a plea, but a roar; not a petition, but an awakening."

Che_Guevara_is_back_desc: "South America is experiencing a revival of faith. Che Guevara seems to be riding a motorcycle again and crossing the Andes. But this time, he is not alone. Millions of Che Guevara are awakening. They will inherit the legacy of this eternally young warrior, break the shackles that have been locked in Latin America for hundreds of years, and realize the dream that countless "Bolivars" have fought for."

A hundred years ago, the gunfire of the October Revolution awakened the world; half a century ago, the red flag in the east guided the way. Today, the long-dormant revolutionary flames are ignited again, more blazing than ever before. The horns have brought a storm sweeping the world. The fortress of the old world will be overturned in this surging red tide, and the dawn of the new world will surely illuminate the future of mankind again."

PRC_Party_Display_Long1: "§RThe party§! no longer exists."
PRC_Party_Display_Long2: "Our party is in a §Rextremely dangerous§! situation. The organizational structure has been severely damaged, and the command system is almost paralyzed; organizations at all levels act on their own and no longer implement central decisions; serious factional struggles have caused internal consumption to an unprecedented level. At this critical moment, the party has lost effective control over the grassroots, the masses have completely lost trust in the organization, and all work has come to a complete standstill. Hostile forces have taken the opportunity to infiltrate our party's cause, causing inestimable damage. It is necessary to immediately activate the emergency protection mechanism, rebuild the command system, eliminate the internal ghosts, restore the organizational function, and save the party from danger. If drastic measures are not taken quickly, the results of many years of struggle will be destroyed, and total collapse may be inevitable."
PRC_Party_Display_Long3: "Our party is facing a §Rserious internal split§! situation. Organizational principles have been severely trampled upon, and disciplinary constraints are in name only; serious factional tendencies have emerged in some places, and central decisions are difficult to implement effectively. Under such adverse circumstances, the party's core leadership position has been seriously challenged, various tasks have fallen into chaos, and the public's trust in the party has significantly declined. We must immediately take resolute measures to eliminate harmful elements, rebuild organizational discipline, restore the party's combat effectiveness and credibility, and prevent the situation from further deteriorating."
PRC_Party_Display_Long4: "At present, there is a relatively obvious §Yinternal dispute§! state in our party. Different opinions frequently collide, and the decision-making process is time-consuming and lengthy; work advancement encounters many obstacles, and reform measures are difficult to form a joint force. Under such circumstances, organizational cohesion is affected, work efficiency is significantly reduced, and mass work is also ineffective due to different positions. It is urgent to strengthen unity within the party, build consensus, and transform different voices into constructive forces to promote the development of the cause through in-depth and meticulous ideological work."
PRC_Party_Display_Long5: "At present, the overall state of our party is in the stage of §Gstable operation§!. Most comrades can perform their duties in accordance with regulations, and various tasks are carried out in an orderly manner; however, their sense of innovation and initiative are insufficient, and there is a certain degree of inertial thinking in their work. In this case, routine tasks can be guaranteed, but the response to complex challenges is relatively slow, and the reform momentum is slightly insufficient. It is necessary to strengthen ideological guidance, stimulate endogenous motivation, and promote the transformation of the organization from "stable maintenance" to "innovative development."
PRC_Party_Display_Long6: "After a series of party rectifications, our party has shown a good trend of §Ysteady progress§!. Most comrades actively responded to the call of the organization and their work enthusiasm was high; although there is still room for improvement in theoretical depth and experience accumulation, through continuous learning and practice, the overall quality of the team is steadily improving. Under this state, various tasks can be carried out as planned, reform measures are effectively implemented, organizational vitality is continuously enhanced, and strong momentum for long-term development is accumulated."
PRC_Party_Display_Long7: "With the comprehensive rectification of party members, our party has returned to its vigorous state at the beginning of its founding. Ideals and beliefs are like §traging fire§!, illuminating the way forward; strict organizational discipline ensures that policies are implemented correctly; bold breakthroughs in reform and innovation have achieved remarkable results in all work. In such an atmosphere, the party's cohesion and combat effectiveness have been greatly enhanced, winning the broad trust and support of the masses, and laying a solid foundation for achieving grand goals."
PRC_Party_Display_Long8: "Our party is in the §Rmost united and strongest§! period in history. The whole party is highly united in thought, firm in will and in action. Theoretical innovation has made continuous breakthroughs, providing strong guidance for practice; grassroots organizations are full of vitality and play their role as a fighting fortress; the quality of the cadre team has been comprehensively improved, and they are brave to take responsibility and dare to fight. The relationship between the party and the masses is as close as a family, and the support of the people for the party has reached an unprecedented level. Faced with complex and changing domestic and international situations, the party has demonstrated strong leadership, execution and creativity, and various undertakings have flourished and grand goals are being steadily achieved. This unprecedented unity and solidarity provides the most solid political and organizational guarantee for the development of the party and the country."

################### Economic Crisis Decision #################
PRC_mobilize_bureaucratic_system: "Mobilize the bureaucratic system"
PRC_mobilize_bureaucratic_system_desc: "Crisis is an order, crisis is a state of war. The greatest advantage of our country in dealing with crises is to mobilize the whole country and unite the whole country. The bureaucratic system is the nerve endings of our national system. We must mobilize these people to mobilize the combat effectiveness of the state machine"
PRC_sell_off_us_treasury_bonds: "Prepare to sell US bonds"
PRC_sell_off_us_treasury_bonds_desc: "The systemic risk of the Wall Street financial system suddenly broke out, and the global capital chain suffered a heavy blow. As the largest holder of US bonds, China is directly facing the direct impact of the evaporation of trillions of assets, and the country's financial security and sovereign independent development are facing severe tests. It is now decided to authorize the State Administration of Foreign Exchange to implement a strategic liquidation of US bonds, complete the reduction of US bond holdings through offshore market transactions, and transform the wealth locked up by Wall Street into living water to support socialist modernization and build a solid national financial security barrier."
PRC_weaken_economy_ties: "Withdraw assets from the United States"
PRC_weaken_economy_ties_desc: "Safety is one of the costs of assets. If the cost of security is far greater than its benefits, we must withdraw these assets as soon as possible. The future of the United States is extremely unstable. If we cannot withdraw these assets as soon as possible, we will lose them forever."
PRC_decouple_from_dollar: "Decouple from the US dollar"
PRC_decouple_from_dollar_desc: "The US dollar has become a piece of waste paper that traders around the world avoid, and the Federal Reserve has become a name with no credibility. If we continue to flirt with the US dollar, our economy will only fall into the abyss. We have successfully adjusted our country's foreign exchange structure. Now, foreign currencies such as the euro, yen, and ruble have filled the position that the US dollar once held, and we have also reserved enough precious metals such as gold. With the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, and the intervention of the central bank, we will sign bilateral or multilateral currency swap agreements with former ASEAN member states, Russia, the European Union, Iran and other countries, agreeing to use the currencies of both parties for settlement in trade. In the face of natural disasters and man-made disasters, win-win cooperation and joint progress are our answers to the world."
PRC_emergency_currency_exchange: "Emergency currency exchange"
PRC_emergency_currency_exchange_desc: "Since the United States has fallen into complete chaos, the demand for the US dollar has dropped exponentially around the world, and the US dollar in our foreign exchange reserves has depreciated at an incredible rate to the point where it is almost worthless. As the management agency of foreign exchange reserves, the central bank will allocate corresponding funds from the foreign exchange reserves for exchange according to the authorization of the Ministry of Finance. We will contact large international banks such as HSBC, UOB, Mizuho Bank, etc., and complete the transaction through a formal foreign exchange exchange platform and clearing system. Please rest assured that our excellent comrades in the Ministry of Finance will use their negotiation skills to get us a more reasonable price. After all, in this global financial storm, no one can be immune."
PRC_restrict_capital_outflows: "Restrict capital outflows"
PRC_restrict_capital_outflows_desc: "Obviously, capital is always blind and short-sighted. The financial storm sweeping the world has caused some foreign capital to fall into a huge panic. They have begun to shrink frantically, which is not what we want to see. We will restrict foreign exchange transactions and strengthen our foreign exchange transaction review system to control the direction and scale of capital flows. In the short term, we will increase Tobin taxes and capital gains taxes, which will deter capital from building high walls. At the same time, we will participate in international economic policy coordination, promote the formulation and improvement of global financial regulatory rules in the absence of the United States, create a stable international financial environment, and let capital stay in the fence with peace of mind."
PRC_local_debt_self_clearance: "Local debt self-clearance"
PRC_local_debt_self_clearance_desc: "Local debt chaos is a cancer that is corroding socialist construction with capitalist greed. Some local governments have blindly borrowed money for political achievements and have become predatory financing tools for financial capital. Now local debt risks are accelerating, seriously threatening regional stability and public financial security. We now order a comprehensive halt to the vicious cycle of "borrowing new to repay old", prohibit borrowing in disguise through implicit guarantees, restructure operating debts, and require all localities to achieve endogenous debt resolution through increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, and industrial revitalization, cut off the connection between financial speculation and public finance, and re-inject resources swallowed by capital into the field of people's livelihood construction."
PRC_storing_reserve_fund: "Storage reserve"
PRC_storing_reserve_fund_desc: "Our country's reserve system was established in 1984 and has developed into a mature system with a complete and meticulous structure. In order to avoid the impact of the aftermath of the collapse of the US dollar, we will appropriately tighten government fiscal spending and cut some non-urgent budgets. At the same time, under the coordination of all parties, the central bank will gradually expand its reserves of gold and other precious metals. In cooperation with BRICS countries such as Russia and Iran, a large amount of natural gas and oil resources will also be included in our reserves in a timely manner. If you have food in your stockpile, you will not panic. Only by being fully prepared can you respond to changes with constancy."
PRC_crackdown_on_financial_speculation: "Crack down on financial speculation"
PRC_crackdown_on_financial_speculation_desc: "Capital never sleeps, it only cares about making money, regardless of the bottom line. The plight of the Party and the country, the disaster of the working people, are in the eyes of some financial speculators a golden opportunity to reap wealth. As the party of the people and the party of the working class, we will use absolute thunderbolts to smash their fantasies and give them a head-on blow. We will introduce timely fiscal and monetary policies to adjust market supply and demand and avoid speculation caused by market supply imbalances. At the same time, regulatory authorities will increase supervision and review of large-scale capital flows in the short term. For identified financial speculation, we will take severe measures, including criminal penalties, to crack down on it resolutely, decisively and promptly. The stock exchange is the lifeblood of the national economy, not a paradise for "adventurers"!"
PRC_strength_government_industrial_guidance: "Strengthen government guidance on production and sales"
PRC_strength_government_industrial_guidance_desc: "Capitalist spontaneous production has led to a disordered supply of necessities for the people and a barbaric expansion of resources into the field of speculation. We now order the National Development and Reform Commission to take the lead in establishing a production and marketing strategic coordination mechanism, accurately guide resources to strategic industries and livelihood security areas, establish a white list system for key enterprises, give priority to their energy and raw material supply, ensure an effective closed loop between the production and consumption ends, and recalibrate the production line alienated by capital to the track of serving the needs of the people."

PRC_emergency_economic_control: "Emergency Economic Control"
PRC_emergency_economic_control_desc: "The market economy has great vitality because of its free state of production, but the result is that it will inevitably become chaotic when facing disasters. When these crises come together, we must take various measures and various means to control the entire economic system, otherwise it will be a mess."
PRC_susband_financial_market_trading: "Suspend financial market transactions"
PRC_susband_financial_market_trading_desc: "Securities, stock markets and other markets have become meat grinders for capital to strangle the real economy. The virtual economic bubbles they have created are frantically devouring the people's hard-earned financial speculation. We hereby order the China Securities Regulatory Commission to suspend A-share, Hong Kong Stock Connect and Bond Connect trading from today, activate the circuit breaker protection mechanism, and during the 30-day transition period, Central Huijin Investment Co., Ltd. will purchase stocks with insufficient liquidity at current valuations, implement mandatory suspension of ST stocks, implement special relief for small and medium-sized investors, transform the stock market casino into a people's financial position serving the real economy, and rebuild the socialist financial order of wealth for the people."
PRC_expedite_foreign_trade_shipping: "Ship foreign trade goods"
PRC_expedite_foreign_trade_shipping_desc: "The collapse of the United States has led to a huge imbalance between supply and demand in the global market. A large number of consumer goods are trapped in the production areas and cannot be shipped out, making the operation of the world economy seriously difficult. As a responsible economic power, and in order to run my country's "international and domestic dual circulation" economic model, my country will mobilize as much transportation capacity as possible to rush to transport foreign trade goods. After the comrades of the Ministry of Commerce reach an agreement with the other party, we will continuously import our necessities to the country through reliable routes such as the "China-Europe Express" and the "Maritime Silk Road". The People's Navy will also be more vigilant to protect the absolute safety of our country's routes."

PRC_impose_emergency_martial_law_on_key_industry_desc: "In the past, US and Western capital and domestic capital agents infiltrated strategic fields such as energy, military industry, and communications through disguises such as "mixed reform" and "listing". Now, the risk of breaking the international capital chain forces us to ensure that strategic industries are autonomous and controllable. We now order the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology to implement emergency control over industries such as energy, chips, and military industry, send military representatives to supervise production at production lines involving national security, adopt closed management for core technology research and development, strictly investigate technology outflows, and establish an autonomous and controllable closed production system."

PRC_mobilize_grassroots_organizations: "Mobilize grassroots organizations"
PRC_mobilize_grassroots_organizations_desc: "Grassroots organizations are the foundation of the party's governance and the source of its strength. Stabilizing the grassroots situation is the fundamental guarantee for the party to unite and lead the people to overcome the crisis. Now relying on the five million grassroots party organizations across the country, we will fully mobilize the forces of communities, streets, factories and other grassroots units, mobilize community grid members and youth commandos, establish a three-level linkage network for economic monitoring, emergency response, and material allocation, refine economic security responsibilities to the smallest governance unit, mobilize the masses to report capital flight and hoarding, build a solid economic security line with the mass line, and form an economic protection system with the participation of all people."

PRC_control_nationwide_public_opinion: "Control national public opinion"
PRC_control_nationwide_public_opinion_desc: "In a state of crisis, people are panicking. It only takes a small spark to lead people in the wrong direction, thus making all our previous plans to deal with the crisis ineffective. We must control those speeches that may cause collective incidents. Only by stabilizing people's hearts can we do a better job."
PRC_essential_goods_price_controls: "Control the price of necessities"
PRC_essential_goods_price_controls_desc: "The sharp fluctuations in the prices of necessities have seriously threatened the basic livelihood of the people and social stability.

It is strictly forbidden for enterprises to hoard goods and drive up prices. Suppliers who refuse to cooperate will be punished by industry entry bans to maintain the stability and fairness of the supply chain, cut off the connection between the supply chain and the international speculative market, and ensure that core strategic materials are independently controllable."
PRC_take_over_bankrupt_enterprises: "Take over bankrupt enterprises"
PRC_take_over_bankrupt_enterprises_desc: "The shock wave caused by the break in the international capital chain quickly spread to my country's private economy.

We now order the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission to take the lead in implementing trusteeship management for key enterprises in the livelihood sector, revitalize assets through state-owned capital injection, collective shareholding by employees, debt-to-equity restructuring, and simultaneously set up special funds to ensure employee resettlement, use institutional advantages to protect the bottom line of people's livelihood, and protect the strategic spark for economic recovery."

PRC_implement_work_for_relief_policy: "Implement work-for-relief policy"
PRC_implement_work_for_relief_policy_desc: "Employment is the most important livelihood. Simply giving money will not solve any problems. We should let the unemployed have something to do.

(World Trade Organization) in 2001, §RChina§! has always been the ballast of world finance and the undisputed §Y"stabilizing force"§! of the world economy. In the §Rfinancial crisis§! that swept the world in 2008, my country introduced a package of plans to deal with the §Rfinancial crisis§! in order to avoid a hard landing of the economy, and gradually improved our measures and fire prevention mechanisms to deal with the §Rfinancial crisis§! in the following decades of development.\nToday, our economic development has encountered the most dangerous reef, §RChina §!The ship heading for rejuvenation encountered the biggest storm in decades - the fall of §YWall ​​Street§! dealt a heavy blow to the world's economy, and the complete chaos of §2American imperialism§! forced us to pay for their credit bankruptcy. In the new round of storms in world finance, we, as the largest §GUS debt holder§!, are the first to bear the brunt...\nNow, the great ship of §RChina§!'s rejuvenation will be steered by you.

We can finally proudly announce that the great Chinese people have overcome this crisis and have used it to reform many chronic diseases in the economic field with the determination to break through and build up.

TFR_PRC_crists_completed: "§RThe deterioration of the crisis§! has been contained"
PRC_end_desc: "When the §YWall ​​Street tsunami§! broke out, almost everyone sentenced §RChina§!, the largest creditor of §2the United States§!, to death. Those countries that were hostile to §RChina§! often seized on some of our shortcomings in the §Gpeople's livelihood§! and §Hindustry§! fields to accuse us and exaggerate, smearing §RChina§! into a hell on earth for ordinary people. But §Gpeople's eyes are sharp§!, the §RParty and the Central Committee§! remained unmoved in the crisis, and all sectors of society were closely united, facing difficulties and working together. Now, we can finally proudly declare that the fire distinguishes jade, and the real gold is tempered - the storm raised by the butterfly on the other side of the ocean did not blow down §RChina§!, but lifted up the §Rred dragon§! to soar into the sky.\nCrisis is often accompanied by Opportunities, and the §RChinese§! are particularly good at seizing the latter - when the §Yeconomic crisis§! destroyed our effective economic structure, we did not panic and dismantle the east to patch the west, but carried out drastic and all-round reforms with the courage and determination to make the final decision, which allowed us to §Gturn crisis into opportunity§!. We were not defeated by the crisis, but emerged from the cocoon as a butterfly, and the dragon soared into the abyss. \nThe smooth resolution of this crisis marks that §RChina§! has survived the biggest crisis since entering the §Ynew era§!. No matter how terrible the storms are in the future, the §RChinese people§! will work together to overcome the difficulties. We will hold our heads high, and together with the people of the world who love peace and desire to overcome injustice, hold our heads high, lift our feet, link our arms, and stride forward! "

TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_PRC_Revolution_Ending: "§3Neoliberals§! once arrogantly declared: "The two greatest things of the 20th century were the §tattempt§! at socialism§! and its §3failure§!." "But we have proven eloquently that the §tSoviet§! and even the alienated §tMarxist§! theories of the West are far from the limit of what great socialism can bring to civilization.\n\nIn the year [GetYear], another new era of §Awar§! and §trevolution§! has uprooted §3capitalism§! from the city on the hill where history ends with the fury of the Third World. In the ruins of the §Aold society§!, the finally liberated workers are looking forward to building a §tnew world with their own hands.§!\nNow, those who once attacked us have to join our ranks, and people are coming in droves to follow the fire of civilization. We will never claim that we have §3reached the limit of civilization, but §tcontinue the revolution§!, and every struggle will bring us one step closer to the world of §Rcommunism§!.\n\n§RNew world, keep moving forward!§!\n\nThank you for playing China! Thank you for playing §RRed Dawn§!!"
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_PRC_Revolution_Ending1: "No one dared to imagine that on the §nruins§! of the Soviet Union, the flames of §Rrevolution§! could be reignited, but the impossible has indeed happened.\nThe will of the §tpeople§! is like a raging wave, unstoppable, sweeping away all obstacles with overwhelming force. Those poor §3reactionaries§! struggled in vain, but were finally completely submerged by the mighty §Rred torrent§!.\nHere, we can proudly declare: "The tide of §Rrevolution§! will never rest. The flame of §tChina§! is ignited today, and it will §Rswept the world tomorrow! §!\n\nWe have only §3shackles§! to lose, and §tthe whole world§! to gain! \n\nThank you for playing China! Thank you for playing §tRed Dawn§!!" "
TFR_CountryClosing_epilogue_PRC_Revolution_Ending2: "When the §tSoviet Union§! collapsed, everyone in the Old World celebrated, declaring that this was the end of §Yhistory§!. But after decades of silence, the defenders of the Old World are trembling under the §RRed Tide§!. \n\nLet the defenders tremble, the red tide incarnated by the people will rise with the §0flames§! burning the §nOld World§!, sweeping the world! \n\nUnder this rising red tide, humans who have broken free from their shackles will stride forward, crush the bones of the §nOld World§!, and write a new page of history with their own hands! \n\nWhat we lose is only our §3shackles§!, and what we gain is the §twhole world§!! \n\nThank you for playing China! Thank you for playing §tRed Dawn§!! "
